  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During October 5 – 10, 2011, a dramatic and long-overdue swath of moisture should push into the central and western Plains states, dropping over an inch of rain on a broad area from the northwestern half of Texas (except the Big Bend) northward through Nebraska and the adjacent Dakotas and Minnesota. Totals may reach 3.5 to 5.5 inches in central Nebraska and also southeastern parts of the Texas Panhandle. Farther east, a tropical system should spread heavy rains across Florida, southeastern Georgia, and adjacent South Carolina. Over 1.5 inch is expected through this region, with as much as 8 inches possible along the southeast Florida coast. Elsewhere, anywhere from a few tenths of an inch to a couple of inches of precipitation should fall on parts of the Rockies, with light rain at best in other areas of dryness and drought.</p>
   <p>For the ensuing 5 days (October 11 – 15, 2011), odds favor a return to dryness from the central and southern Intermountain West eastward through the southern Plains and middle Mississippi Valley, including most of Texas. In contrast, wet weather is favored in the northern Rockies and in the dry areas of the Southeast.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Drought conditions remained unchanged in Alaska and Puerto Rico this week.  In Hawaii, further degradation was noted D1 to D3 conditions expanded in northeastern sections of the Big Island. Farther south, D3 was introduced along part of the southern Big Island coastal areas.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic">
   <p>Hit-and-miss light rainfall continued again in and near the areas of dryness in New York and West Virginia. As a result, the D0 areas were reconfigured a bit but their intensity remained unchanged.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Ohio Valley">
   <p>A swath of heavy rain (generally 4 to locally 8 inches) wiped out dryness in southern Indiana and adjacent areas, but in other sections, specifically south-central Kentucky and areas from west-central Indiana westward, dryness and drought persisted.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Midwest">
   <p>Several inches of rain eased dryness and drought in the upper Peninsula of Michigan, and more moderate rains kept drought depictions unchanged in the remainder of the Great Lakes region. Farther west and south, in areas from central Kansas to northern Missouri and northward through the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, short-term but intense dryness has led to the rapid development and expansion of dryness and drought. Many areas have received less than one-quarter of normal precipitation in the last 30 to 60 days, along with above normal temperatures. The rapid development of dryness quickly depleted topsoils, even leading to fires in some brush and even crop areas. Drought now covers areas from southeast Iowa to eastern South Dakota, with severe drought now observed in southern Minnesota.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South">
   <p>Over 4 inches of rain soaked part of the central Lower Mississippi Valley, allowing D0 to D3 conditions to be scaled back to the west. Elsewhere, moderate to locally heavy rains fell on northeast Oklahoma and southern Missouri, but appeared insufficient to substantially change drought conditions there. In the rest of the region, the theme of the last year was again played out: Little or no precipitation, and increasing moisture deficits except in small isolated areas. Several small adjustments were made in parts of the region, but of course the sprawling D4 area centered on Texas can’t be depicted any more seriously than it already was. Some larger-scale changes included expansion of D4 with growing shorter-term deficits in southeast Oklahoma, a westward expansion of D0 to D3 conditions along the immediate southwestern Louisiana coast, and the extension of D1 conditions eastward to cover most of Arkansas. Several reports of dry pastures affecting livestock were noted, and despite recent near-normal precipitation, water supplies remain a concern in northwest Arkansas as well as throughout the large area of exceptional drought.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Areas of heavy rain again affected parts of this area, leading to some drought/dryness reductions in the central Carolinas and finally slicing a hole in the large D3 area centered on Georgia, in particular across the interior southeast, where totals of 4 to 8 inches fell during the last 2 weeks. Similar rainfall during this period in central and west-central Georgia was not quite adequate to bring a classification improvement, but was sufficient to justify scaling back the dryness and drought in southwestern Alabama. Light precipitation led to expansion of D0 to D3 conditions in western South Carolina and adjacent North Carolina, where about half of normal rainfall was observed over the last 30 days.</p>
   <p>South of these areas, D0 to D3 areas expanded southward in the central Panhandle and in parts of the northern Peninsula. Six-month deficits exceed one foot now in parts of the central Peninsula. Across southern Florida, rain has been spotty but locally heavy recently, and quite a few minor adjustments to the region’s D0 to D2 areas were made this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>A re-assessment of rainfall during the past few months led to a reduction from D4 to D3 conditions for a small area in southeast New Mexico, but otherwise, light precipitation at best kept existing dryness and drought intact from the High Plains westward through the Rockies and Intermountain West.</p>
