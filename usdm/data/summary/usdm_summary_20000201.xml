  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>February 2 - 7 should bring moderate precipitation (0.5 to 1.0 inch) to southern and lower central Texas, but little or none is anticipated elsewhere. The ensuing 5 days (February 8-12) should again be drier than normal across central and northern Texas and much of Florida, but surplus precipitation is anticipated in the upper Southeast, across the Tennessee, lower Ohio, and northern lower Mississippi Valleys, and in the Texas Panhandle and adjacent Oklahoma.</p>
   <p>During February 2 - 7, precipitation totals above 0.25 inch should be restricted to portions of northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas. Most areas are forecast to receive light but measurable amounts, except for the northern Plains, where no precipitation is anticipated. Fortunately, early indications are that February 8 - 12 may offer some improvement to parts of the region, with surplus precipitation forecast in the central Plains and the middle Mississippi and lower Ohio Valleys. In contrast, subnormal precipitation is again expected in the northwestern Plains, the central and eastern Great Lakes, and the upper central Appalachians.</p>
   <p>Wet weather, marked by 0.3 to 3.0 inches of precipitation, is expected to effect the northern two-thirds of California again during February 2 - 7, but elsewhere measurable amounts should be restricted to southwestern California and the northern tier of the abnormally dry region. For February 8 -12, wetter than normal conditions are expected to allay some of the abnormal dryness in central and southern California, central and southern Nevada, and the western two-thirds of Arizona. However, near- or below-normal precipitation is expected elsewhere.</p>
   <p>Mild and relatively dry weather is expected for the next week, but longer-term prospects continue to look promising. Slow relief is expected as the rainy season continues.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Light to moderate rain and subnormal temperatures covered Hawaii during the last 7 days, leaving D1 conditions essentially unchanged across western parts of the Big Island, most of Molokai and Lanai, and all but northwestern parts of Maui.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Midwest, and Central Appalachians">
   <p>In contrast to areas farther south, precipitation was relatively light (generally below 1 inch) from central Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Tennessee northward through the Plains and Great Lakes. Scattered totals of 0.2 to 1.0 inch were observed in the central Plains and southern Great Lakes region while little or no precipitation fell elsewhere. As a result, D1 conditions expand into western Kansas and the northeastern Plains. Portions of southwest Kansas, western and northern Minnesota, and eastern South Dakota received less than 25% of normal precipitation during the last 90 days.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and Western States">
   <p>Moderate to heavy precipitation (1 to 4 inches) pelted substantial portions of the region, including central California, most of the Sierra Nevada, parts of the upper southern California coast, western Nevada, and some higher elevations in Utah and Colorado. In parts of the Sierra Nevada, several feet of snowfall were measured. Most other areas in the West that have been experiencing abnormal dryness for the past several months (except the desert Southwest) recorded at least 0.2 inch of precipitation. This storminess allowed D0 (abnormally dry) conditions to recede away from parts central California, northwestern Nevada, and adjacent parts of Oregon and southwest Idaho. In addition, D0 conditions were eliminated in central Colorado, but other parts of the West benefitted only slightly from last week's precipitation. Since October 1, 1999, less than 75% of normal precipitation were recorded in the southern Sierra Nevada and across most areas south of southern Idaho, western Wyoming, and southern Colorado. In southwestern New Mexico and much of central and southern Arizona, less than 25% of normal precipitation fell during the last 4 months.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South-Central and Southeastern States">
   <p>Significant precipitation fell on many locations from eastern Texas eastward through the Gulf Coast states over the last 7 days. Between 1 and 3 inches fell on much of eastern Georgia, South Carolina, central and western Alabama, and scattered sections of central Mississippi, northern Louisiana, southern Arkansas, and northeastern and southeastern Texas. Only central and west Texas and parts of the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys, where totals were generally below 0.2 inch, missed significant precipitation. It was a cold week throughout the region, with temperatures averaging at least 5oF below normal allowing much of the precipitation to fall in freezing or frozen form, except along the immediate Gulf and Atlantic Coasts. Despite the beneficial precipitation, marked improvement in drought conditions was limited to west-central Georgia, where drought status was lowered to D1 (first stage drought). Farther west, D1 conditions expanded in southern and western Texas. The region's largest 90-day precipitation deficits (7 to 10 inches) were observed in part of the lower Mississippi Valley.</p>
