  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>For September 16-21, 2009, little or no rain (up to 0.25 inch) is expected across the drought areas in Texas. A large portion of the interior Southeast US is forecast to receive 1.5 inches or more during this period, which would be very beneficial for the D0-D2 drought areas indicated over much of the Carolinas and southern portions of both Louisiana and Mississippi. The southern portion of the developing dryness (D0) indicated over the central Appalachians is the most likely area to receive significant rainfall (0.25-0.50 inch), while prospects for more northern areas are not as favorable. Rainfall amounts of 0.10 inch or less are expected over the upper Mississippi Valley, the Dakotas, and Nebraska, doing little to alleviate dryness/drought in those areas. Light rain (0.10 - 0.50 inch) is projected for the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies, with the heavier amounts probable over western Washington. In the Southwest, rainfall amounts generally between 0.50 - 1.50 inches are predicted over New Mexico, helping to reduce drought over portions of the state, while southeast Arizona may get up to 0.10 inch of rain.</p>
   <p>For the ensuing 6-10 day period (from September 22-26), fairly wet and cool conditions appear to be in store for the eastern half of the country, with abnormal warmth and dryness across the western third of the nation.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>In Hawaii, lack of rainfall across Oahu has prompted the introduction of D0 conditions across central portions of the island. With little or no precipitation reported in southeast Alaska, no revisions were made to the existing D0 area.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Atlantic Coast States">
   <p>A slow moving storm off the mid-Atlantic coast brought moderate (0.5 to 1.5 inch) amounts of rain to central and southern sections of both the Appalachians and the adjacent eastern foothills, and the Tidewater area of southeast Virginia. Little if any rain fell across central portions of North Carolina and eastern South Carolina. Very spotty areas of moderate to heavy rain (1.0 to 2.0 inches) were reported over parts of eastern Georgia. The area of D1 conditions was expanded over central North Carolina, and much of South Carolina. Stream flows for the past few weeks have also been abnormally low for this region. In the central Appalachians, very little rainfall has been reported in the past few weeks, so an area of D0 conditions has been highlighted on the Drought Monitor map.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Central Plains">
   <p>Localized areas of moderate to heavy rain (1.0 to 2.5 inches) were reported mainly over parts of York county in southeastern Nebraska, though the remaining portions of the area designated D0 have received normal to below normal rainfall.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest">
   <p>Several frontal systems brought moderate to heavy rains (0.5 to 2.5 inches) to central and eastern North Dakota, western portions of Minnesota, and parts of South Dakota. This rain supports limited improvement across much of the area. However, not all areas have received significant precipitation. D0 conditions were expanded across southwestern North Dakota and adjoining parts of South Dakota, and D1 conditions were expanded across southeastern Minnesota and neighboring Wisconsin.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southern Plains and Gulf Coast Region">
   <p>Widespread, beneficial rains (generally 2.0 to 5.0 inches, locally heavier) fell across much of central Texas, Oklahoma, and southeast Louisiana, thanks to a nearby quasi-stationary frontal system and the availability of copious Gulf moisture. In Oklahoma, the steady, soaking rains over the past few days have resulted in the removal of D0 and D1 areas in southwestern parts of the state, with little to no precipitation reported across the Panhandle region. In north-central, central, and south-central Texas, the recent rains have provided much needed short-term relief for agriculture. These rains were mostly absorbed by dry soils, with a comparatively small fraction of this water being available to recharge rivers and streams. This demonstrates that the longer-term, hydrologic drought is still far from over in this region. Selected rainfall amounts include 4.51 inches at Corpus Christi (September 9-12), 2.51 inches at Austin (September 9-12), 4.66 inches at San Antonio (September 8-12), and 5.60 inches at Brownsville (September 7-11). Localized amounts of 6 to 10 inches or more have been received in southern Dallas County and portions of nearby counties, and these heavy rain totals continue southward along the I-35 corridor to Jarrell, TX (about 40 miles north of Austin). In addition, generally 1.0 to 3.0 inches of rain has fallen across portions of the lower Rio Grande Valley. Therefore, significant, shorter term improvement is indicated for Texas. In southeastern Louisiana and adjacent southern Mississippi, recent rainfall has resulted in the removal of D1 conditions, and decreased coverage of D0 conditions.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>With the exception of light rains (up to a third of an inch) across western Washington, little if any precipitation fell across the Pacific Northwest, California, and Nevada. A reassessment of the dryness in Utah resulted in the decrease in coverage of D0 conditions. Light amounts of rain also fell over portions of Arizona, with localized areas receiving as much as 1.0 to 2.0 inches of rain, especially across the elevated terrain of south-central Arizona. Showers and thunderstorms resulted in moderate to locally heavy rains (0.5 to 2.0 inches) across primarily southwestern and north-central New Mexico.</p>
