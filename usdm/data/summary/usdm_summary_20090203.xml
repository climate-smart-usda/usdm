  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Wet weather out west will contrast with mostly dry conditions in the eastern U.S.  For the rest of the week, a strong area of high pressure will maintain dry weather in the Southeast but bring a hard freeze to Florida.  Meanwhile, a Pacific storm will move ashore over the weekend, bringing much-needed rain and mountain snow to the western U.S.  As this system emerges over the central High Plains early next week, a large area of snow and rain will develop from the Dakotas southward into eastern Texas.  Gulf moisture surging northward will lead to locally heavy rain in the middle and lower Mississippi River Valley by mid-week, while another Pacific storm impacts the Northwest.</p>
   <p>The CPC 6-10 day forecast (February 10-14) calls for mostly warm, wet weather over the eastern half of the nation, although drier-than-normal conditions are expected to linger in Florida and southern Texas.  Out west, colder-than-normal conditions are expected, with wetter-than-normal weather in the Southwest and Four Corners Region contrasting with below-normal precipitation in the Northwest.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Reports from Hawaii indicated pastures in Molokai and Lanai improved with recent rainfall, although water levels in western Molokai remained low.  In Puerto Rico, isolated showers (locally more than 2 inches) were reported during the past week, although amounts in the current D0 area were generally less than half an inch.  Dry weather prevailed in northern Alaska, while locally heavy rain fell along the southern coast.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Delta">
   <p>Light to moderate rain stemmed the expansion of drought in the Delta, although streamflows continued to run at lower-than-normal levels.  Temperatures for the week averaged near to slightly above normal.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest and Northeast">
   <p>Dry, increasingly warm conditions over northern areas contrasted with a moisture-laden winter storm farther south.  In particular, locally heavy rain, freezing rain, sleet, and snow eradicated lingering dryness from Kentucky into western Pennsylvania.  However, precipitation amounts were generally light (less than half an inch) in northwestern Pennsylvania, doing little to ease D0 dryness in that portion of the state.  Drought remained unchanged in the upper Midwest, where early-week cold (temperatures as low as -26 degrees F) gave way to above-freezing daytime highs by week's end.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Drought expanded under a dry weather regime across the south, although rain provided some relief in eastern Oklahoma.  In Texas, wildfires, extremely low streamflows, barren pastures, and declining wheat conditions were symbolic of worsening drought over much of the state.  Drought intensity and coverage expanded over most of the state, although light rain provided some relief to eastern portions of Texas.  The same held true in Oklahoma, where rain eased drought in the east while dryness increased D1 and D2 drought coverage in the west.  Farther north, additional snow eased long-term hydrologic drought in North Dakota, while conditions remained unchanged in eastern Montana.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Showers spread over much of the region, although unfavorably dry weather prevailed in eastern portions of Georgia and South Carolina.  Streamflows continued to decline in North Carolina, where D1 and D2 drought expanded over the western half of the state.  In contrast, light rain across eastern North Carolina provided a temporary reprieve from expanding dryness.  In western South Carolina, improving reservoir levels led to a slight reduction of Extreme Drought (D3).  In eastern portions of South Carolina and Georgia, increasing abnormal dryness (D0) along the coast reflected 30- and 90-day precipitation departures in excess of 2 and 4 inches, respectively.  Abnormal dryness also expanded over southern Alabama, where rain from this week's storm system (less than half an inch) did little to offset developing moisture shortages.  In Florida, 1 to 2 inches of rain in the northern half of the state eased short-term dryness.  Across southern Florida, a fast-moving line of showers and thunderstorms produced generally less than one-quarter inch of rain; consequently, D0 remained unchanged, while moderate drought (D1) increased slightly along the southeastern coast.  D0 also expanded further into the Florida Panhandle, reflecting declining soil moisture percentiles and 90-day precipitation deficits greater than 5 inches.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>A broad ridge of high pressure maintained mostly dry weather over much of the western U.S.  In California, drought designations increased north of Santa Barbara, with Extreme Drought (D3) now extending from the northern California coast to the Nevada border.  In this region, streamflows are in the lowest 5th percentile while 90-day precipitation departures are approaching 16 inches.  In addition, mountain snowpacks in the Sierra Nevada are alarmingly low, with sustained stormy weather over the next 6 weeks needed to fully recharge water reserves.  Elsewhere, abnormal dryness (D0 ) and moderate drought (D1) increased over northwestern Montana in response to a lack of a current snowpack, while abnormal dryness expanded northward in Oregon in response to 90-day precipitation departures of more than 8 inches.</p>
