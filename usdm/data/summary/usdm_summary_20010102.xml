  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Systems predicted to affect the Nations drought areas include: 1) The country can expect a reprieve from any more Arctic air invasions in the short term, leaving us with a relatively quiet weather pattern over most of the country until early next week. This will result in much warmer air filtering back into most all of the eastern half of the country as the jet stream takes on a more zonal flow over the next few days; 2) There are now signs that the persistent high pressure (and subsequent blocking ridge) in the southwest may be displaced by early next week, which could signal the start of a more active (wetter) weather pattern in the Pacific Northwest and/or West; 3) High pressure will continue to suppress any immediate relief in Hawaii and Puerto Rico; 4) Although weak, La Nina continues to hang around (keeping drier than normal conditions over the equatorial Pacific around) but should weaken within the next three months according to the latest ENSO forecast issued by the Climate Prediction Center (12/11/00). The persistence of this La Nina will continue to hamper the improvement of drought conditions in the southeastern United States.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Another quiet week was seen over the Hawaii as high pressure and the trade winds havent improved the abnormally dry (D0) or moderate drought (D1) affected areas on the islands. In Puerto Rico, abnormal dryness (D0) remains intact across southwestern and north-central areas.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes Region">
   <p>The broken record continues to spin here as bitter Arctic air remained entrenched across virtually all of the region. Many cities saw record, or near-record, snowfall amounts during December. Abnormally dry (D0) conditions are now relegated only to the extreme eastern parts of the Upper Peninsula as a result of above normal precipitation during the past few weeks. Even with the abundant snowfall and well above-normal precipitation totals in parts of Iowa and Nebraska, the drought will remain, lying dormant for now across the region. Keep in mind that it typically takes around 8-10 inches of snow to make one inch of liquid water. A lot of these snows have, in fact, been on the drier side pushing the water content down.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South">
   <p>Last week saw a continuation of well below-normal temperatures across the entire region, but beneficial precipitation of 2 to 4 inches or more fell across parts of northeast Texas, northern Louisiana, southern Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Parts of northern Louisiana and Mississippi even saw heavy snow on New Years Eve. While the recent rains of the past few weeks have been enough to slightly reduce the areas of severe drought (D2) across parts of the south and southeast, it should be noted that most of the region isnt seeing enough rain to put much of a dent in the long-term shortages (deficits of 15 inches, or more, was common along the Gulf Coast states for the year 2000). The airport at New Orleans, LA experienced its driest year since official weather observations started there in 1946. Using other official long-term data collected in New Orleans, it was the third driest year since 1836.</p>
   <p>Florida also saw the colder air but didnt receive near as much precipitation as their neighbors to the north. Amounts were generally less than one inch at best. Drought conditions have not improved here and hydrological impacts actually continue to worsen as reports roll in describing low streamflow, lake and groundwater levels, which should be at much higher levels this time of year. The risk of wildfires continues to be a major concern as we head into the new year. Many cities in southwest Florida and surrounding areas havent had a drier year going back over 75 years.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>High pressure continued to keep a strangle hold on much of the West and Pacific Northwest, repulsing any invasions of moist Pacific air into the region. The dry start to the water year continues here as many of the basins are reporting much below average snowpack. It is important to keep in mind that there is a long way to go in the snowpack season and the pattern can break down and change quickly. In addition, the water systems here are meant to buffer against a year or more of dryness and reservoir levels are generally in good shape. Impacts are being seen however, along the coastal and valley areas of central and south-central California where abnormally dry (D0) conditions have been seen over the past three months, causing high concerns for wildfires. The lack of precipitation is also having an effect on non-irrigated agricultural activities such as winter pasture conditions for livestock and for planting wheat.</p>
