  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather conditions which may have an impact on abnormally dry or drought areas during December 24-25 include an ongoing East Coast storm that has, is, and should drop significant precipitation on the south-central Plains, Southeast, and Northeast, respectively. During December 26-30: 1) Several Pacific storm systems should bring additional precipitation to the West, but mainly to areas in and west of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, with much lower amounts in the Intermountain West and Rockies; 2) East of the Rockies, colder and drier conditions will prevail behind the Christmas storm once it moves off the Atlantic Coast, with a gradual warm-up in the central U.S.; 3) A storm system may develop in the southern Plains late in the period.</p>
   <p>The NWS 6 to 10-day outlook (December 31, 2002-January 4, 2003) features above-normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, South, and Atlantic Coast States, while drier-than-usual conditions persist in the Southwest, southern Rockies, northern Plains, and upper Midwest. Above-normal readings should occur in the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies and Plains, and the northeastern quarter of the U.S., with subnormal temperatures limited to the Southwest.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>While light scattered showers dampened orographically-favored, windward sections of the islands, little or no rain fell on leeward portions, maintaining moderate drought on western Molokai and abnormal dryness on western Kona (Big Island), while expanding moderate drought (D1) on southwestern Maui. Although October was very wet across Maui, November only brought between 7 to 39% of normal rainfall to southwestern sections, and rainfall during the first 23 days of December has been nearly non-existent at Ulupalakua, Kihei, Kula, and Pukalani (less than 0.10 inches, with December normals between 2.5 to 4 inches).</p>

  <region name="Puerto Rico">
   <p>Seasonal easterly flow produced widely-scattered light to moderate showers during the week, maintaining short-term dryness (D0).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The East">
   <p>Another winter storm system, this time without a supply of Arctic air as temperatures averaged 3 to 6F above normal, swept across the Atlantic Coast States, producing light to moderate rains (0.5 to 1 inch) from Georgia northward into Maine, maintaining D0-D1(W) throughout the region. The exception was in northeastern Maine, where 2-3 inches of rain erased dryness east of Interstate 95. Thanks to the recent spate of wet weather, one must now go back at least 12-15 months to find widespread precipitation deficits greater than 5 inches, and 15 months for percentiles less than 12.5%ile in the Atlantic Coast States.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest and Plains">
   <p>The El Nino-enhanced subtropical jet stream continued to bring frequent storm systems across southern sections of the Plains and Midwest, with the most recent system spawning several days of severe weather, including tornadoes, in Missouri (Dec. 17), Arkansas (Dec. 18), and Mississippi (Dec. 19). Most of the significant rains fell on areas without drought, except across eastern Missouri, central Illinois, and southwestern Indiana (1.5 to 3 inches occurred), somewhat diminishing D0-D1 areas there. It has been a feast or famine for rainfall in this region. For example, Peoria, IL received 2.04of rain Dec. 17-18, but only 1.55 for the previous 73 days (Oct. 5-Dec. 16), and all-time record low autumn (Sep-Nov) precipitation of 2.92, or 34% of normal. Elsewhere, light precipitation kept conditions status quo, with an eye on the Ozarks for improvement as a strong storm system approached at the end of the period.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>An active Pacific storm track brought another strong storm system to the West, generating moderate to heavy precipitation (1.5 to 4 inches, locally up to 6-7 inches), but the majority of the precipitation fell on and to the west of the southern Cascades and Sierra Nevada, bypassing much of the northern Cascades, Intermountain West, and Rockies. As a result, additional dryness and drought relief occurred across the Sierra Nevada, San Joaquin Valley, and the Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas. In contrast, precipitation was much lighter to the east (0.2 to 0.5 inches, locally 1-2 inches in the Wasatch, parts of the Colorado and New Mexico Rockies), maintaining drought conditions. October 1-December 23 basin average precipitation (PNP) and snow water content (SWC) remained below-normal across much of the West (except the Sierra Nevada: 130-137% PNP, 155-197% SWC), especially in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies where season-to-date precipitation and snow water content percentages remained under half of normal. The Great Basin and central Rockies were only slightly better, with values between 50-80%. In the Southwest, temperatures averaging 5 to 10F below normal and scattered light showers minimized any impacts related to wildfires and agricultural, leaving only long-term hydrological impacts.</p>
