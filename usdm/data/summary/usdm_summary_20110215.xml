  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <intro>
   <p>This week featured a fairly dry pattern for much of the contiguous US while a stormy pattern brought rains (1.0 – 5.0 inches) to southern Alaska and western Hawaii (0.5 – 4.5 inches).  Across the contiguous US, a low-pressure system moved across the southern tier of the country during the middle portion of the week.  By Friday, high pressure and dry conditions dominated the pattern for most of the country.  Activity across the northern tier of the country picked-up later in the week with a storm system brining snow showers and lake-effect snows to the northeast and another storm system making its way into the Pacific Northwest.</p>

  <forecast>
   <p>February 16 – February 22, 2001 – The atmospheric flow pattern is expected to bring significant precipitation to central California and the Intermountain West.  The storm track should support some of this moisture moving across the central Great Plains.  Most of the southeast should remain locked in a dry pattern through early next week before some precipitation is likely across the lower Mississippi River Valley.</p>
  </forecast>
  <region name="Great Plains">
   <p>Recent snows have done little to alleviate drought across Oklahoma and northern Texas as the liquid equivalent of the snowfalls have been approximately 1 inch, resulting in snow-liquid ratios of up to 20 to 1.  Most of these snows fell across eastern Oklahoma.  The low liquid equivalents and windy conditions followed by a warming trend later in the week contributed to an expansion of moderate drought (D1) conditions across the central portions of the state.  Across the western Texas panhandle, abnormal dryness (D0) was expanded as SPI-3 and SPI-6 values indicated worsening drought conditions.  One report of 1.5 inches of precip surrounded by a few reports of less than 1 inch of precipitation were noted, so D0 conditions were not expanded across the entire region.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Rainfall across Puerto Rico was minimal in coverage with the most significant rains (1.0 – 2.0 inches) falling across the northwestern sections and east-central sections of the island.  Light precipitation (generally less than 0.5 inch) was reported across most of the island with the exception of the southwestern quadrant where dryness continued.</p>
   <p>A stormy pattern brought more rains (0.5 – 6.6 inches) across southern Alaska.  This prompted a small reduction in the coverage of D0H (abnormal dryness) across south-central Alaska.  Dry conditions continued across interior Alaska with less than 0.5 inch of precipitation reported at any station.</p>
   <p>The drought status across Hawaii remained unchanged as the western islands continued to receive the most precipitation and dryness continued across the big island.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Rockies and Southwest">
   <p>Inputs from the NIDIS: Upper Colorado River Basin Pilot Project reflected some recent precipitation and increased snowpack measurements across south-central Colorado.  In response, the western edge of the area of D2 (severe drought) was trimmed.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southeast and mid-Atlantic">
   <p>With the exception of central Tennessee and a small section across Florida, most areas received less than 0.8 inch of precipitation for the week.  The continued dryness across the southeast has aided in the formation of several brush fires in places from Alabama to Virginia.  Winds gusting to near 50 mph aided fires the spread across southwest and south-central Virginia, which were likened to fires from the historic February 10, 2008 event. Some precipitation (0.5 – 1.5 inches) fell across northern Florida and a stalled frontal boundary brought sparse precipitation (0.3 – 1.2 inches) to southern Florida, which was enough to maintain the current drought conditions without additional intensification.</p>
   <p>Across western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, continued dry conditions prompted the expansion of moderate drought (D1) conditions and abnormal dryness (D0).  As reported during the North Carolina-Drought Management Advisory Council Technical Drought Advisory Team weekly teleconference, streamflows across North Carolina trended downward.  SPI3 (Standardized Precipitation Index for 3 months), SPI6 (Standardized Precipitation Index for 6 months), and soil moisture values from the Climate Prediction Center indicate conditions slightly worse than the severe drought (D2) indicated across the Carolinas but relative wetness at the 9-month time frame (SPI9), some decent well and reservoir storage levels pre-empted the introduction of extreme drought (D3) conditions.</p>
   <p>Continued dryness across most of Alabama prompted the expansion of abnormally dry conditions across all of the state and a small expansion of moderate drought across the central portions of the state.  SPI6 and SPI9 indicate severe dryness while SPI3 indicates moderate drought and many streamflows are well below the 20th percentile.</p>
