  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>For the next 5 days, heavy precipitation (1 to 3 inches) is forecast for southern Missouri and adjacent areas, the northwestern Great Lakes region, and substantial sections of southern California, Arizona, central Utah, western Colorado, and near the Idaho/Wyoming border. In contrast, little or no precipitation is anticipated in the central and southern Great Lakes region, the southern High Plains, central and eastern Montana, central and western Nevada, and the northern two-thirds of California. For the ensuing 5 days (November 2  6, 2004), the odds favor above-normal precipitation from northern Utah northward to the Canadian border and westward to the Pacific Coast, and in southeastern Alaska. Meanwhile, below-normal precipitation seems more likely from southern Kansas, central Oklahoma, and central Texas westward across New Mexico and most of Arizona.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Alaska">
   <p>A relatively dry week led to persisting dryness and drought conditions in these states. Moderate drought (D1) continued in eastern parts of the Big Island in Hawaii, and abnormal dryness (D0) persisted on Maui and across northeastern Alaska. In addition, 3-month precipitation totals have been significantly below normal in central and northern sections of the Alaskan Panhandle, leading to the introduction of D0 conditions in those regions.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Central States and Great Lakes">
   <p>Between 1 and 3 inches of precipitation fell on scattered locations in the regions D0 and D1 areas, prompting 1-category improvements where moderate precipitation was most widespread, including the southwestern and north-central Great Lakes region, east-central Kansas, and the fringes of the D0 and D1 areas in southern Missouri and adjacent locales. In contrast, a dry week was observed from northern Kansas northeastward through western Wisconsin, prompting D0 expansion in Iowa and adjacent sections of Missouri and Wisconsin. Precipitation totals for the last 90 days averaged about half of normal in these regions.</p>

  <region name="The High Plains, Rockies, and Far West">
   <p>A potent storm system swung through the western half of the United States last week, bringing widespread heavy (and in some cases, record-breaking) precipitation to many of the areas entrenched in a multi-year hydrologic drought. One storm, even a record-breaking storm, is not enough to relieve drought in the many areas where precipitation shortfalls and low reservoir levels have deepened consistently over the course of several years, but the scope and magnitude of last weeks precipitation was certainly a welcome change for most of the region.</p>
   <p>Last weeks heaviest precipitation fell on the coastal and mountainous regions of California, and on a swath extending from northwestern Arizona northward through Utah and extreme southeastern Idaho, where reports exceeded 2 inches at most locations, and approached 1 FOOT in parts of the California mountains. Scattered totals of 1 to locally 4 inches were common in most other areas of dryness and drought from the Rockies westward to the Pacific Coast, with light precipitation totals restricted to the High Plains and southwestern Wyoming.</p>
   <p>The widespread storminess eradicated any lingering surface moisture shortages, and even brought tangible improvement to some of the areas entrenched in deep, multi-year hydrologic drought. Last weeks D2H and D3H conditions improved by 1 category in most of Utah, part of west-central Wyoming, central and northwestern Arizona, southeastern and west-central Nevada, and a large part of central and southern California. In addition, the storminess brought D0 conditions to an end in west-central California.</p>
   <p>Compared to local climatology, the most remarkable amounts fell on central and southern California, western Arizona, most of Nevada and Utah, southeastern Idaho, and portions of central and western Wyoming. The percent of normal precipitation for the one year period ending October 23 was 25 to 30 percent higher than for the one year period ending October 16 in western Arizona, and running one-year percent of normal precipitation totals got a 12 to 25 percent boost the rest of the aforementioned regions.</p>
   <p>Space does not permit a comprehensive list of the new rainfall records established this week, but it should be noted that several locations established new all-time single-day precipitation records late last week, and at least one location received more precipitation in one day than they had ever recorded for an entire month of October.</p>
