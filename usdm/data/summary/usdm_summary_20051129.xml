  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 5-day period (December 1-5) that may affect areas of dryness or drought include: 1) a storm system will generate some snow in the Great Lakes region on December 1, followed by lake-effect snow squalls in climatologically favored areas; 2) a second storm will trail the first system, crossing the central Plains late in the week and reaching the Mid-Atlantic States during the weekend. Some light snow may blanket the northern Plains, while rain (and possibly wet snow) will develop across the South and East; 3) a third storm system will take shape early next week across the central and eastern U.S. Although the storms exact path is not yet certain, significant precipitation may occur in conjunction with this system; and 4) during the entire period, unsettled, showery weather will prevail in the West as far south as central California, the northern Great Basin, and the central Rockies.</p>
   <p>The 6- to 10-day (December 6-10) outlook from the Climate Prediction Center calls for below-normal temperatures from the eastern Plains to the East Coast, while warmer-than-normal weather will prevail west of the Rockies. Meanwhile, near- to above-normal precipitation is expected nearly nationwide. Wet conditions are most likely across the northern Rockies, the northern Plains, the Great Lakes region, and the southern Atlantic States. Drier-than-normal weather will be confined to parts of California and the Southwest.</p>

  <region name="Alaska and Hawaii">
   <p>Heavy precipitation continued in coastal sections of southeastern mainland Alaska but failed to spread inland far enough to significantly alter the area of abnormal dryness (D0). Likewise, locally heavy showers dotted Hawaii but did not provide significant relief from abnormally dry conditions. On Maui, Kahuluis 1.43-inch rainfall on November 27 boosted its November 1-28 total to 1.76 inches (88 percent of normal).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest">
   <p>Showers and thunderstorms crossed the Midwestern drought area (stretching from the Missouri River near Omaha, Nebraska, to southwestern Lower Michigan) on November 27-28. With respect to that drought area, rainfall was heaviest (locally 2 inches or more) in central Illinois. Some reductions in the coverage of abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate drought (D1) were introduced, primarily from central Illinois to Lower Michigan.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Abnormally dry (D0) conditions bridged the gap between previously existing such areas in central Texas and across Texas northern panhandle. November precipitation totals in central and northern Texas included a trace in both Abilene (1.30 inches below normal) and Childress (1.06 inches below normal). No rain fell during November in San Angelo, Texas, for the first time since 1988 and only the fifth time since the beginning of the 20 th century. In Texas northern panhandle and adjacent areas in northeastern New Mexico and westernmost Oklahoma, a broad area of moderate drought (D1) was introduced.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, Texas winter wheat crop continued to deteriorate, according to USDA. On November 27, Texas wheat was rated 49 percent very poor to poor, up from 30 percent on November 13. Other very poor to poor ratings in Texas on November 27 included 72 percent for range and pasture and 78 percent for oats. Topsoil moisture was rated at least 95 percent very short to short in several of Texas Agricultural Statistics Districts, including the northern half of the High Plains (roughly the northern panhandle), East Texas (including Dallas-Ft. Worth), and the southern half of the Trans-Pecos region (east-central Texas). Oklahomas statewide topsoil moisture was rated 91 percent very short to short on November 27, while winter wheat was rated 17 percent very poor to poor. On November 27-28, a powerful storm system crossing the central Plains resulted in widespread wind gusts in excess of 60 m.p.h. In eastern Oklahoma, grass fires sparked by downed power lines consumed as many as 50,000 acres of vegetation and burned nearly three dozen homes, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
   <p>Farther north, an early-season blizzard struck parts of the northern and central Plains on November 27-28. Among the hardest hit areas were portions of Nebraska and South Dakota, where wind-driven snow fell. In addition, some ice accumulations were noted from the eastern Dakotas into the upper Midwest. As a result of the storm, reductions in the coverage of abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1) were made from Nebraska northward into the Dakotas and Montana.</p>

  <region name="The South">
   <p>Following the substantial precipitation event of November 20-21, locally heavy showers and thunderstorms returned to the South after Thanksgiving. Heavy rain developed along and near the western Gulf Coast on November 26, when Corpus Christi, Texas, netted a daily-record total of 4.05 inches. Abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate to severe drought (D1 to D2) receded from the Texas coast, but only minor changes were observed farther inland, where little or no rain fell. In fact, moderate to severe drought expanded across Deep South Texas. Through November, year-to-date rainfall totaled just 12.91 inches (49 percent of normal) in Brownsville, Texas. Farther north, significant precipitation again bypassed the gradually expanding core area of extreme drought (D3) centered in northeastern Texas, where Dallas-Ft. Worth (DFW) completed its fourth-driest meteorological autumn and driest since 1975. DFWs September-November precipitation totaled 2.27 inches, or 25 percent of normal. Just to the south, Waco, Texas, netted autumn rainfall totaling just 1.97 inches (22 percent of normal), second only to a 1.50-inch sum in September-November 1989. Meanwhile, January-November precipitation deficits topped 20 inches in locations such as Alexandria, Louisiana (23.99 inches below normal), and De Queen, Arkansas (22.07 inches below normal). In both Alexandria (31.06 inches) and De Queen (27.79 inches), year-to-date rainfall stood at 56 percent of normal).</p>
   <p>Farther north and east, showers and thunderstorms provided varying degrees of relief from abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate to severe drought (D1 to D2). In fact, abnormal dryness was largely eradicated from Alabama and Georgia. Both core areas of severe drought (D2), centered in eastern Kentucky and central North Carolina, respectively, received rainfall locally in excess of 1 inch, with additional amounts observed in the latter region on November 29.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Heavy precipitation fell in the Pacific Northwest, while light rain and snow showers spread east of the Cascades across the interior Northwest. Although there has been a good start to the winter wet season in much of the Northwest, there are still serious hydrological drought issues and there are many months left for the situation to change. For example, October-November precipitation typically accounts for less than 25 percent of the normal annual precipitation in Washington and Oregon. Nevertheless, there were some widespread reductions in abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate to extreme drought (D1 to D2) across the interior Northwest. Farther south, however, portions of central California were designated abnormally dry (D0) as storms passed to the north. Earlier in the autumn, rain also fell farther south, across southern California and the southern Great Basin. Since July 1, rainfall in Fresno, California, totaled 0.26 inch (13 percent of normal).</p>
