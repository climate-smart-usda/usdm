  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Features to watch in the next 10-day period: 1) a frontal passage through the Deep South and the Southeast (6/29-7/1) will bring welcome rains (over 2" in some areas) to the area before high pressure builds in and conditions turn hot and humid heading into the July Fourth holiday; 2) in the Midwest, developing high pressure should lead to a build-up of heat across the region as the mercury reaches the mid to upper 90s by the weekend (7/1-2) and continues through the first week of July. Even with the heat, there remains a good chance of above-normal rainfall as a result of scattered thunderstorms that may pay a visit to a large portion of the First Stage (D1) and Severe (D2) Drought areas in the Midwest after the Fourth of July holiday period; 3) hotter and drier conditions should return to the Southwest, quieting the recently active monsoon-type weather pattern seen in the region.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Extreme Drought (D3) concerns involving agriculture and wildfire potential continue to exist for Maui and a small part of the Island of Hawaii. Long-term deficits in some areas continue to accumulate at an alarming rate. Year-to-date deficits through 6/25/00 show Lihue in the west at 37% (-13.33"), Honolulu at 20% (-9.00"), and Hilo in the east at 58% (-27.08") of normal.</p>
   <p>Abnormally Dry (D0) conditions are now being seen in the Tanana Valley of Alaska (around Fairbanks), where recent above-normal temperatures coupled with below-normal rainfall have led to area topsoil moisture levels being rated as 60% short and 40% adequate.</p>
   <p>Abnormally Dry (D0) conditions continue to be seen along the northern coast of Puerto Rico.</p>

  <region name="Midwest">
   <p>The past week continued to bring generous rainfall to most of the Midwest, especially to those areas seeing the worst of the drought this summer. These rains (3-8" or more in some areas) removed Extreme Drought (D3) from southeastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa and northwestern Missouri. Long-term deficits and Severe Drought (D2) conditions still remain across parts of these three states, so the area still bears watching as we head into the hotter and drier months of summer. Where locally heavy rains were more frequent in the Missouri River Valley area between Nebraska and Iowa, conditions improved somewhat as Severe Drought (D2) was downgraded to First Stage Drought (D1) for the time being. In many cases, the recent rains were enough to replenish the top soil but haven't entirely reduced or eliminated long-term deficits. Without the security blanket of sub-soil moisture in many places, the crops are still more vulnerable than usual this year and will still require timely rains over the coming weeks. The pocket of Severe Drought (D2) in south central Missouri remains intact as the heavier rains have either steered north or south of this region, leaving rainfall deficits in excess of 15 to 20 inches or more since July of last year.</p>
   <p>Severe (D2) and First Stage Drought (D1) conditions also continued to creep south and west out of Nebraska and into northeastern Colorado. Triple-digit heat has accompanied this dryness over the past few weeks in western parts of Nebraska, Kansas and northeastern Colorado.</p>
   <p>Continued rains in the Red River Valley and northern Minnesota allowed Abnormally Dry (D0) conditions to be eliminated. First Stage Drought (D1) conditions were also eliminated in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. After another week of good "drought-busting" rains, and subsequent improvement of conditions in western Indiana and central Illinois, the areas of drought have been downgraded. In Indiana, this means we are no longer showing any signs of dryness, and only the western quarter of Illinois remains in an Abnormally Dry (D0) designation. To date, it has already been the third wettest June on record (going back to 1895) in Illinois, which has certainly lead to a reversal of fortunes as many areas now have seen too much water.</p>

  <region name="Southeastern States">
   <p>Precipitation across the region was spotty at best and was most active in southeast Georgia and extreme northeast Florida. Otherwise, conditions continued to deteriorate as First Stage (D1) and Severe Drought (D2) pushed farther south into Florida and up into western North Carolina and Virginia as well. The core regions of Extreme (D3) and Exceptional (D4) Drought in the Southeast remained unchanged for the most part this week as rains once again avoided these areas. Many locales in Alabama, Georgia and Florida have accumulated year-to-date rainfall deficits of 10-20 inches.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Western States">
   <p>Parts of New Mexico, Arizona and western Texas received rains, signaling a welcome start to the monsoon season in this region, and many are hoping for a very active season to make up for the dry winters of the past two years. Hydrologic drought (D0, D1 and D2 W) is still a reality across most of western Texas even though areas of Severe Drought (D2) have receded westward toward New Mexico because of recent rains. There has been enough improvement in the past few weeks to eliminate Extreme Drought (D3) in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. This does not lessen concerns in the region however, as 126 community water systems (as of 6/20/00), primarily located in north central, central and northeast Texas, are currently limiting water use. Amistad Reservoir is holding 37.5% of conservation storage while Falcon Reservoir is holding less than 11.5%. Extreme fire danger is now isolated to extreme western parts of Texas (Trans-Pecos region).</p>
   <p>Abnormally Dry (D0) conditions continued to spread over parts of Idaho and Montana making the threat of fire one of the main concerns there.</p>
