  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>For the next 5 days (May 30-June 3), warmer-than-normal temperatures should dominate almost the entire country except for the Mississippi delta, where it should be cooler than normal. As far as precipitation is concerned, the only drought areas expecting to see relief of an inch or more are found along the Gulf Coast and up into South Carolina. It should be noted, however, that these amounts are about what these areas would normally expect. Normal rains of -1 inch are expected up the Atlantic coast as well.</p>
   <p>During the period June 4-June 8, temperatures are expected to be above normal across the West, South, and Southeast, and up into the Ohio Valley. Cooler-than-normal temperatures appear to be coming to the central and northern Plains states as well as in New England. Below-normal precipitation can be expected in the Gulf Coast states, northern tier states, and the interior of Alaska. Above-normal precipitation is likely in the central Plains and the Rocky Mountains from Wyoming down to New Mexico. The Mid-Atlantic region from Pennsylvania down to northern Georgia and northern Alabama is also expected to share in the above-normal rainfall department over the same time period. Southern Alaska looks to be warmer and wetter than normal during this forecast period.</p>

  <region name="Texas and the Gulf Coast">
   <p>Most of the drought-affected areas saw little relief in the way of rains last week. Rains seen in the Big Bend, Trans Pecos and Rio Grande did little but buy a few days as the accumulated deficits continue to mount in the face of the hot summer months to come.</p>
   <p>Although parts of north central Louisiana did see some light rain last week, it wasn't enough to keep severe drought (D2) from advancing through southern Mississippi and into the southern coastal areas of the state. Already this year, New Orleans has accrued an 11-inch deficit (55% of normal).</p>
   <p>The rest of the region saw very little, if any, rainfall last week in the southern reaches of Alabama, Georgia and northern Florida. As a result, all drought depictions in Georgia (D1, D2 and D3) have expanded slightly to the west and north.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Central and Northern Plains">
   <p>Rains of 2 to 4 inches or more were reported from Nebraska all the way down to the Texas Panhandle. A pretty distinct gradient exists between the haves and the have nots, as depicted by the drought delineations on the map. This weeks rains have led to a slight push westward for most of the areas on the fringe where rain fell (south central NE, north central KS, western OK and the TX Panhandle).</p>
   <p>In the High Plains, abnormally dry (D0) conditions have now spread eastward in the Dakotas and into northern Minnesota after a dry spring. Year-to-date precipitation totals were only in the 40-65% of normal range going into the last few days of May. Above-normal precipitation on the year has pulled the Black Hills region out of abnormally dry (D0) conditions.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The East Coast">
   <p>Locally heavy rains (4 inches or more) fell in parts of northern Virginia and western Maryland, but little fell elsewhere. The dryness gradient here also continues to steepen as the drought is compressed further eastward in and around points directly north and south of the Washington, D.C., area. Although year-to-date precipitation totals are now in the normal range, long-term deficits (10-15 inches from Georgia to New England) still remain since October 1, with most of the Atlantic Seaboard seeing 50-75% of their normal precipitation during this time frame. The short-term relief continues, but widespread recovery for the lagging streams and groundwater levels will likely have to wait until the tropical storm season begins in earnest, or until the fall, as the hot summer months come calling. Until then, most of it will come in the form of hit-and-miss thunderstorm activity throughout the summer.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Last week was relatively quiet, although a last blast of winter brought some much-needed precipitation in the western half of Montana. Most locations on the lee side of the Rockies remain in a long-term drought and year-to-date totals range from 50-75% of normal. The short-term events havent brought nearly enough precipitation to eradicate the drought felt in some places for more than 5 years now.</p>
   <p>In California, abnormally dry (D0) conditions have now spread northward into the Sacramento Valley. Many locations up and down the coast and the I-5 corridor have seen less than half of their expected precipitation, with deficits of 5 to10 inches or more on the year seen from Redding (-10.03 inches) in the north to San Diego (-5.94 inches) in the south.</p>
   <p>As impacts continue to make the news in the Southwest, exceptional drought (D4) has evolved over the last year or more in parts of southeast Colorado, northern New Mexico, southeastern Utah and northern Arizona. The threat of fire remains high and has led to water rationing and full, or partial, park closings across the region.</p>
   <p>Alaska continues to see warm weather accompanied by a rapid melting of snow. Moderate drought (D1 F) has developed in the southeast from roughly Yakatut (-25.22 inches/ 23% of norm since 3/1) to Annette Island (-10.43/ 48% of normal since 3/1). Keeping in mind that drought isnt a total absence of rainfall, abnormally dry (D0) conditions have now spread onto Kodiak Island as the deficit since March 1 has now exceeded 10 inches (40% of normal), even given the recent rains of last week.</p>
   <p>In Hawaii, the reservoir situation in western Molokai remains unchanged.</p>
