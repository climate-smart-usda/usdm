  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 5-day period (September 1-5) that may affect areas of dryness or drought include: 1) Relatively tranquil weather will prevail nearly nationwide in the wake of Katrinas passage through the Southern and Eastern United States; 2) In early September, scattered showers will return to the Southwest; 3) Also in early September, locally heavy showers will develop across the southwestern half of Texas, including the Rio Grande Valley; 4) Starting around September 2, showers will begin to overspread the northernmost Rockies and the Pacific Northwest.</p>
   <p>The 6- to 10-day (September 6-10) outlook from the Climate Prediction Center calls for near- to above-normal temperatures and near- to below-normal precipitation nearly nationwide. Below-normal temperatures will be restricted to the Southeast, while wetter-than-normal weather will be confined to the central Plains and the southern Atlantic region.</p>

  <region name="Alaska and Hawaii">
   <p>In late August, heavy precipitation fell across parts of southern and eastern Alaska. However, abnormal dryness (D0) persisted in parts of the Alaskan interior, where Fairbanks August 1-30 rainfall totaled just 0.19 inch (11 percent of normal). Meanwhile in Hawaii, isolated heavy showers accompanied near-normal temperatures. On the leeward section of the Big Island, 24-hour rainfall totaled 5.46 inches in Waiaha on August 28-29. Meanwhile on Oahu, Honolulus daily average temperature of 81 degrees F on August 29 was 1 degree below normal and snapped an astounding streak of 155 days (March 27 - August 28) with at or above-normal daily average readings.</p>

  <region name="The Midwest and the South">
   <p>Core extreme drought (D3) areas centered over northwestern Illinois and near the Texas-Arkansas border were not affected by rainfall from Katrina and thus were virtually unchanged from the previous week. However, Katrinas heavy rain shield clipped areas of abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate to severe drought (D1 to D2) along and near the Mississippi River as far north as the Missouri Bootheel, helping to push drought boundaries westward. In the Delta, Yazoo City, Mississippi, netted a storm-total rainfall of 6.50 inches.</p>
   <p>Farther north, rains not associated with Katrina helped to cut the band of moderate drought (D1) across Missouri. Despite recent rains, 68 percent of Arkansas ranges and pastures were rated very poor to poor on August 28, according to USDA, along with 61 percent of those in Missouri and 54 percent in Illinois. Meanwhile, minor reductions in coverage of dryness (D0) and moderate to severe drought (D1 to D2) were noted in parts of Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota. In contrast, abnormal dryness (D0) was re-introduced across southern Michigan and northern Indiana, where drier-than-normal conditions in August and from March-June were briefly interrupted by relatively wet conditions in July. Meanwhile in southern Texas, hot, mostly dry weather allowed for an slight northward expansion of dryness (D0) and moderate drought (D1).</p>

  <region name="The Ohio Valley and the East">
   <p>On August 30-31, the remnants of Hurricane Katrina tracked from western Tennessee into New York, sparking heavy rainfall. Katrina helped to replenish soil moisture reserves from the Mid-South into the Northeast, eliminating severe drought (D2) and reducing the coverage of abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1) in the middle Ohio Valley. Katrinas rainfall spread into the Northeast after the drought monitoring period ended at 8 a.m. EDT on August 30 and will be reflected in next weeks depiction. Prior to Katrinas arrival, more than 5 inches of rain pelted parts of Bristol County, Massachusetts, on August 29-30. That rain, along with lighter amounts elsewhere in coastal southern New England, reduced the regions coverage of dryness (D0). Elsewhere, an area of D0 was introduced in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina due to recent rainfall deficits and low streamflows.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>There were only minor changes to the drought depiction on the northern and central Plains. Abnormal dryness (D0) was introduced in parts of southeastern Colorado, where little rain fell during July and August. From July 1 - August 30, Pueblo, Colorado, netted 2.19 inches (51 percent of normal). Farther north, increasingly dry conditions were also a concern on parts of the northern High Plains, where Helena, Montana, received rainfall totaling just 0.36 inch (14 percent of normal) from July 1 - August 30.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Monsoon showers subsided in the Southwest, leaving most areas from the Rockies westward dry in late August. The long-term, hydrological drought situation remained generally unchanged, but agricultural conditions deteriorated toward the end of summer. By August 28, Washingtons ranges and pastures were rated 42 percent very poor to poor, up from 23 percent just two weeks earlier. With Northwestern ranges and pastures and deteriorating and the winter wheat crop establishment season typically underway by early September, an agricultural designation (A) was added to the drought depiction.</p>
