  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Forecast conditions that may affect areas of dryness and drought from March 28 - April 1 include: 1) A series of weather disturbances will traverse the northern tier of the nation and bring the possibility of light rain or snow to the northern Plains, Northwest, and Northeast; 2) A slow-moving storm system is forecast to cross the southern United States during the last two days of March and early April, and provide beneficial precipitation to parts of Arizona, New Mexico, northern Texas, southern Oklahoma, and the middle and southern Atlantic States; 3) However, little or no precipitation is expected during the period across the central Rockies and central Plains. The NWS 6-10 day outlook for April 2-6 calls for very warm, mostly dry weather to prevail in areas west of the Rockies. Near- to below-normal temperatures are forecast from the Plains eastward, although significant precipitation will be confined to the Northeast. Meanwhile, mostly dry weather will persist in areas along and adjacent to the Kansas-Oklahoma border.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Hawaii had a dry week after the eastern islands' heavy rainfall from March 17-19, although heavy showers (up to 6 inches per 24 hours) returned to Kauai on March 24-25. Moderate hydrological drought (D1 W) lingered across western Molokai. Meanwhile, locally 1 to 2 inches of rain fell across the abnormally dry (D0) southern coastal region of Puerto Rico, with the heaviest rain falling on March 17 and 18.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The East">
   <p>Precipitation lingered across areas east of the Appalachians through March 20, improving topsoil moisture in many locations but having little effect on long-term precipitation deficits and subsoil moisture shortages. Drought remained extreme (D3) in parts of southern and eastern Maine, and in portions of the middle and southern Atlantic States from New Jersey to east-central Georgia. Meanwhile, some additional reduction of dryness and drought was noted along the western fringe of the Eastern drought area, primarily in the central Appalachians and the middle Ohio Valley. Precipitation returned to the East on March 25-26, although the bulk of the moisture fell after the cutoff (7 a.m. EST on March 26) for the production of this weeks Drought Monitor.</p>

  <region name="The Plains and Midwest">
   <p>Despite frequently cool March weather, pastures and winter wheat recently entered the growing season across the southern half of the Plains. Wheat began to emerge from dormancy in very poor to poor condition, according to USDA, on 48 percent of the acreage in Oklahoma, 44 percent in Kansas, and 37 percent in Colorado. In Texas, where winter-crop development was advancing and spring planting was well underway (for example, 47 percent of the states corn and 30 percent of the sorghum was in the ground on March 24), 49 percent of the winter wheat rated very poor to poor. Pastures and ranges on the High Plains reflected similar effects of long-term moisture deficits, rating 61 percent very poor to poor in Oklahoma, followed by 52 percent in Texas, 51 percent in Wyoming, 44 percent in Colorado, and 39 percent in Kansas.</p>
   <p>Some additional rain fell in western Texas and the southeastern half of Oklahoma early in the period (mostly on March 19), followed by a return to dry weather and rapid temperature fluctuations. Elsewhere across the Plains and Midwest, beneficial snow blanketed some locations as far south as northern Kansas and northern Missouri, although effects on dryness (D0) and moderate drought (D1) were minimal. Meanwhile, conditions deteriorated across the core severe drought (D2) area in southwestern Kansas and the Oklahoma panhandle, resulting in some northward expansion into Colorado.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>In a repeat of a weather pattern that has dominated the West since November, beneficial precipitation fell across northern and central California, the Pacific Northwest, and the northern Rockies. Meanwhile, little or no precipitation was observed across southern California and the Southwest. Meager high-elevation snow packs continued to reduce spring runoff potential in portions of the central and southern Rockies and the Southwest. According to SNOTEL reports from USDA, season-to-date precipitation (October 1, 2001 - March 26, 2002) ranged from less than 30 percent of normal in several Arizona and southwestern New Mexico river basins, to slightly greater than 70 percent of normal in the northern Colorado Rockies. During the same period, precipitation totaled just 4.01 inches (27 percent of normal) in Flagstaff, Arizona, while season-to-date snowfall totaled 38.9 inches (43 percent of normal and significantly below Flagstaffs 2000-01 total of 109.4 inches through March 26). Las Vegas, Nevada, received its first measurable precipitation of the year (0.10 inch) on March 24, the citys latest first rainfall since April 1972.</p>
   <p>In the Southwest, severe drought (D2) was expanded across southern Nevada and portions of Arizona and New Mexico. In addition, an agricultural designation (A) was added to the wildfire threat (F) across the Southwest, in part due to deteriorating pasture and range conditions (70 percent very poor to poor) in Arizona. In contrast, some additional slight improvement in varying degrees of dryness (D0) and drought (D1 to D3) was noted across most of the interior Northwest. Meanwhile, parts of south-central Alaska had a rather impressive snow storm on March 16-17, with 28.7 inches falling in less than two days at Anchorage. However, little of the moisture spread across interior southeastern Alaskas abnormally dry (D0) area.</p>
