  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>The next five days (September 21-25) show the potential for a low pressure system to work its way across the country from Northern Rockies to the Atlantic, with the possibility of widespread moisture in the northern third of the country.  To the south, scattered rainfall is likely.  Seasonal temperatures are expected across most of the country.</p>
   <p>For the ensuing 5 days (September 26-30) above-normal precipitation is expected across the northern tier of states into the Great Lakes region, and then southward from the Great Lakes to Texas and into the lower Mississippi Valley.  Precipitation is expected to be below normal in Florida.  We can expect to see colder-than-normal temperatures across most of the western half of the country, and warmer-than-normal temperatures across most of the eastern half.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Dryness continued across the Islands, with no improvement from last week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Midwest">
   <p>Weekly rainfall totals of more than 2 inches fell in the area where South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa meet.  As a result, the D1 area improved to D0.  Improvement also occurred in eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota, where weekly rainfall totals were around 1 inch, and in south central Oklahoma, where weekly rainfall totals were locally more than 2 inches.  Except for south central Nebraska, eastern Colorado and western Kansas, areas that were dry for the whole week, rainfall throughout the rest of the Plains was about a quarter to a half an inch.  This rain kept conditions from worsening, but there was not much improvement.</p>
   <p>Persistent dryness has once again led to the expansion of D3 in northern Minnesota and worsening conditions in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Low streamflows and depleted soil moisture levels are reason for concern heading into the recharge season.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies, West, and Southwest">
   <p>The Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies continue to be dry.  Fires are abundant in Washington and Idaho, and dryness is increasing in Montana.  Conditions in Wyoming and Colorado mostly remained the same as last week, but did improve slightly around the eastern Colorado-Wyoming border.  The monsoon is rolling along in the Southwest, bringing steady relief to Arizona and New Mexico; severe drought is now limited to northeastern Arizona.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast, Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic and Mississippi Valley">
   <p>Widespread heavy rains in these regions led to at least 1-category improvements in almost all areas that were in D1 or worse conditions.  Most noticeable was the improvement in southern Texas, where some areas improved by two categories.  A series of storms throughout the regions dumped more than 3 inches in several areas.  While it is unusual to experience such widespread changes to the drought conditions in one week, a lot of water fell from the sky.</p>
