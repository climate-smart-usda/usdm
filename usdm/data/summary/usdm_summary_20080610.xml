  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 5 days (through June 16) heavy rains are expected across the country's midsection, with the best bet found in the eastern portions of the central Plains and into the Midwest and upper and western reaches of the Great Lakes. The northern tier states from Idaho to New York could also see some beneficial precipitation during this period. In general, at least seasonal rains are expected over most of the Southeast, with some areas expected to see a bit more in southern Florida and northern Alabama, two areas that could really stand to benefit. Temperatures are expected to be above normal across most of the West and Southwest and into Texas as well, while below-normal readings will be likely across the northern Plains and western Great Lakes regions. In a respite from last week, more seasonal temperatures are forecasted for the East and Southeast over the next five days.</p>
   <p>The CPC 6-10 day forecast (June 17-21) unfortunately shows a greater chance for below-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures from the southern and high Plains westward into the Southwest and Intermountain West. Cooler temperatures and normal to above-normal precipitation are possible in the Great Lakes and New England. The Southeast looks to be wetter than normal with temperatures likely to be seasonal. Eastern Alaska also looks to be both hotter and drier than normal.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Impacts are beginning to ramp up now in Hawaii after yet another relatively dry week. The persistent dryness has led to low streamflow levels, and voluntary restrictions are being called for in Kauai County. This has led to the expansion of D1 eastward in Maui along with the introduction of D1 this week to northeastern Kauai. On Maui, the National Weather Service noted that low streamflows have not been adequate enough to support both diversions for Upcountry water supplies and natural streamflow needed for the lowland taro crops.</p>
   <p>Spotty rains missed most of the D0 areas in both eastern Alaska and southern Puerto Rico, leading to no changes this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Mid-Atlantic and Southeast">
   <p>Blistering heat and very little in the way of significant rains has led to more expansion of  D0-D3 across the region, particularly in northern Georgia, eastern Tennessee, southeastern Kentucky, Virginia and the Carolinas. After some slow but steady improvement since the beginning of the year, the high-demand season is now in high gear and conditions have slipped a bit under the influence of triple-digit heat in some places. Impacts are now reflective of this shorter-term dryness and heat, leading to the reintroduction of the AH impact designation for much of the region after predominantly being in H (hydrological) status in the months prior. In addition, D0 has also forged its way into portions of central and western Louisiana this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>It was hard to beat the heat last week. This recent heat, coupled with generally little precipitation over the past 30 to 60 days, has led to the introduction of D0 in parts of western and southern New York as well as up into New England.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Upper Midwest">
   <p>The northern and central Plains can't seem to shake the persistent stormy pattern that has been plaguing them recently, with most of the headlines dedicated to flooding and severe weather. From a drought perspective, though, we continue to see a whittling away of drought in the Dakotas and portions of Minnesota. A general one-category improvement is noted in North Dakota this week, and a pushing of the D0 northward into northern South Dakota occurred as well, where rainfall totals were 2 to 3 inches. Over the past two weeks, eastern North Dakota has seen anywhere from 2 to 4 inches or more. The D3 in western North Dakota has been entrenched for some time now and while some improvement is noted, a lot more timely rain is going to be needed before further recovery is noted. One area that has been missing out on these rains is the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. An introduction of D0 is noted there this week.</p>
   <p>It's a different story in the southern Plains, though, where scorching temperatures, high winds, and very spotty rains have led to more expansion this week across parts of Oklahoma and Texas. In fact, according to the National Weather Service, the period of September 2007 through May 2008 for San Antonio was the driest on record at 6.57 inches, which is a good 2 inches lower than the previous record of 8.89 inches, set during that same period ending May 1956. In addition, Austin has already reached top four all-time status for the number of 100 degree days observed for the May-June period with over half a month to go.  Deterioration worth noting is found in the introduction of D3 in the Big Bend region of Texas, and an expansion of D0-D2 is now depicted in western, southern, and much of eastern Texas as well. All of the Texas Panhandle is now in D0, with a small area of D1 emerging in extreme southwest Oklahoma and across into Texas in the extreme southeast corner of the Panhandle.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>The only change of note this past week in the West is the removal of D1 in north central Montana. Recent rains and totals since the beginning of the year and even back to the beginning of the water year have led to this change. Cooler temperatures have also helped aid the cause.</p>
