  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <intro>
   <p>The overall weather pattern for this past week featured a trough across the western half of the contiguous 48 states, a ridge east of the Mississippi River, and a smaller low-pressure system that moved across the Southeast. A low-pressure system that moved out of the western trough brought the first appreciable rains to the central and southern Plains since the second week of August.  Dry conditions persisted across much of the Northeast for the entire week, while a storm system brought windy and wet conditions to the Southeast earlier this week.</p>
  </intro>
  <forecast>
   <p>October 13-20, 2011 – Early in the period, a pair of storm systems will generate widespread, locally heavy showers from the Midwest and Mississippi Valley into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with lighter showers falling across the Gulf Coast and Southeast.  Over the weekend, breezy, cooler conditions will settle over much of the eastern U.S., while a weak Pacific disturbance will bring light rain – and perhaps even some wet snow – to northern portions of the Rockies and Great Plains.  Elsewhere, high pressure will maintain dry, increasingly warm weather from the central and southern Pacific Coast into the central and southern Plains, including the Four Corners Region.  The NWS 6- to 10-day outlook for October 18-22 calls for drier-than-normal conditions from the Pacific Coast to the southern Plains.  Conversely, wetter-than-normal weather is expected across the Midwest, Southeast, and northern Plains.  Above-normal temperatures across much of the western U.S. will contrast with cooler-than-normal weather from the central and southern Mississippi Valley into the Southeast.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Drought conditions expanded slightly across Hawaii as rainfall has been sparse across many locations.  SPI3 and SPI6 indicate mostly near normal conditions, except for the southwest portions of the Big Island, where SPI3 shows dry conditions.  Weekly rainfall totals were less than 0.5 inch for most leeward stations, so drought conditions expanded slightly on the leeward sides of Oahu and Maui.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Northern Great Plains and Upper-Midwest">
   <p>The drought conditions across much of the upper Mississippi River Valley deteriorated as rainfall was near 0 for much of the region, highs nearly reached 90 degree F, and weekly temperatures averaged 5 to 15 degrees F above normal.    The above-normal temperatures increased the demand for water. Pan evaporation, measured at the University of Minnesota St. Paul Campus Climate Observatory, set a record of 2.32 inches from October 1-10 with data going back to 1972.</p>
   <p>A small area of significant rainfall occurred across Nebraska and South Dakota, but the heaviest rains missed the current drought areas.  D0 (abnormal dryness) was removed from the western portions of South Dakota and Nebraska to reflect what rains did fall across those locations. The impacts were more mixed across eastern South Dakota as improvements were made east of Aberdeen, but near Sioux Falls D1 (moderate drought) conditions were expanded to reflect the on-going short-term dryness and warm temperatures.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Rockies and Southwest">
   <p>Some improvements were made across Colorado and northern New Mexico to reflect recent rains (SPI-3 values near or above 0 and weekly rainfall totals ranging from 0.5 -2.5 inches).  Across the San Luis Valley, many areas in D3 (extreme drought) as of last week, received over 2 inches of rain in the past week.  Although top soil moisture in the area is showing near normal conditions, longer term SPIs still depict D2, thus severe drought remained in the region.</p>
   <p>Across northern New Mexico, improvements were made to reflect short-term wet conditions.  Rainfall totals ranging from 0.9 inch to 2.5 inches were reported for the week. The bulk of the rains fell across Rio Arriba and Taos counties, so that is where the most improvements were made.  Longer term indicators (SPI6, SPI9, and soil moisture) all indicate that the recent rains have not overcome longer term deficits.</p>
   <p>Across Montana and portions of Idaho, rainfall in excess of 2.0 inches alleviated the abnormal dryness.  Dry conditions are indicated from 30-90 days in the past, but beyond 3 months, SPI and percent of normal precipitation all indicate wet conditions.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southeast and Mid-Atlantic">
   <p>A low-pressure system brought significant rains to much of Florida and the Southeast.  Most locations reported between 1.0 and 3.0 inches with some locations across Florida reporting up to 10 inches of rain through the data cutoff (8am Tuesday).  Improvements were made across Florida and Georgia to reflect these beneficial rains.  These heavy rains were especially beneficial, falling on the Kissimmee River basin and the Chain of Lakes.</p>
   <p>Farther north, across the Carolinas, the drought depiction reflected continued dry conditions, with interspersed periods of wetness leading to some disagreement among the indicators.  Many of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauges across central and eastern North Carolina are reporting below-normal flows and longer-term Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values indicate very dry conditions.  More recently, eastern North Carolina and central and eastern South Carolina have reported near or above-normal rainfall, indicated by SPI values greater than 0.</p>
   <p>Abnormal dryness returned across much of Louisiana in the wake of Tropical Storm Lee during early September.  Statewide rainfall deficits, as measured from September 6, 2011 are averaging 3.61 inches, with some climate divisions having precipitation deficits in excess of 4.0 inches.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southern Great Plains">
   <p>Significant rains (0.75 inch to over 7.0 inches) fell across an area from Kansas to central Texas.  One category improvements were made across central Kansas and Oklahoma, with isolated areas of 2-category improvements across Texas.  Some areas received very little rain so the improvements were minimal in spatial extent.</p>
   <p>Across Oklahoma, only Great Salt Plains Lake and Arcadia Lake showed any appreciable response to wide swatch of 3-5 inches of rain.  Most of the rain was absorbed locally, with locations across the panhandle and farther east receiving little rain.</p>
   <p>Lubbock received 0.16 inch and now has deficits of 13.10 inches (normal is 16.26 inches for the year). ). Childress reported over 1.5 inches but continues to have a deficit of nearly 14 inches. Aspermont, TX, in Stonewall County, received over 2.75 inches. A few of the West Texas Mesonet sites had modest soil moisture in the upper part of the profile, but of the rainfall was absorbed by the soil and did not contribute to significant run-off to recharge streams and lakes.  The biggest beneficiaries to this week’s rains would be pastures, ranges, and winter wheat.</p>
