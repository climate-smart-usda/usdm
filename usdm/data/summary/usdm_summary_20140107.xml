  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the January 9-13, 2014, time period, a strong ridge appears primed to set up camp for the next couple of weeks, bringing better prospects for well above-normal temperatures across most of the country. The only notable exception is southwestern Colorado, where temperatures are expected to be slightly below the norm. A strong storm system could bring the first considerable widespread winter event to the Pacific Northwest, particularly the western halves of Oregon and Washington as well as the Idaho Panhandle. Good moisture is also predicted for the southern Plains (eastern Kansas, eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas), Lower Mississippi Valley, Gulf Coast and the Southeast. The Northeast may also see some good precipitation materialize over this period. The Southwest and northern Plains look to remain dry.</p>
   <p>For the ensuing 5 days (January 14-18, 2014), the ridging pattern looks to remain entrenched bringing better odds of continued above-normal temperatures across the entire West and into the western Plains from Texas northward to North Dakota. New England is another region looking to share in the warmth. Alaska, the Great Lakes and the Gulf Coast appear to be headed for below-normal temperatures. As for precipitation, this pattern tilts the odds toward below-normal for the West and central and southern Plains while Alaska, the northern Plains, Great Lakes and the eastern Seaboard can expect a better chance of above-normal precipitation.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>The windward (mostly confined to the northeast-facing slopes) areas of the state saw significant precipitation this past week while the leeward (western) areas of Maui and the Big Island remained very dry for the most part. This has led to a mixed bag of both improvements and deterioration on several islands. Of note, Molokai saw improvement through a pushing west of D0-D1. Longer-term drought and impacts on the rest of the island keep D1-D3 in place. Continued rains across Maui’s northeast slopes in and around Haleakala leads to a reduction of D0-D1, and recent rains in the Upcountry area led to reduction of some D3 there as well. Lanai continues to see below-normal rainfall and as such the northwest half of the island has slipped from D1 to D2 on this week’s map. The Big Island has seen better rains over the past several weeks (particularly along the northeast-facing slopes), leading to localized heavy rains and flash flooding. Both D0 and D1 have been pushed farther west. The area of D3 near Upolu and Hawi improves from D3 to D2 this week as well. Spotty rains over the interior and leeward areas of the island brings expansion of D2 to the southern Kohala District as ranchers are still pressed into hauling water for livestock and the threat of fire is still high. The D3 in central Hawaii also expands a bit eastward as well. Finally, conditions in and around Kona warrant a degradation from D0 to D1.</p>
   <p>Conditions remain unchanged this week in both Alaska and Puerto Rico.</p>

  <region name="The Central and Northern Plains and Midwest">
   <p>Bitter cold and snows swept across most of the Plains and Midwest this past week. Given the time of year, frozen soils and lack of impacts, no changes were made on the map this week as the dryness and drought remain freeze dried in place.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>The recent wetness of the past month or so has generally resulted in improvement in the dryness and drought across much of the Northeast and southern New England. Both D0 and D1 have been reduced across parts of eastern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey as well as in southeastern New York. However, the recent storm systems haven’t been as favorable to those in northern New England, as D0 expands from northern Vermont eastward across northern New Hampshire and into northwestern Maine. In addition, the southern coast of Maine also saw a slight expansion of D0 a bit more inland because of the longer-term seasonal dryness that stretches back to early October.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Modest rains were scattered across much of the region last week, but not enough fell to offset longer-term seasonal dryness, so status quo applies to most areas. The exception to this is in southern Alabama and the extreme western counties of the Florida Panhandle, where D0 expanded slightly after contracting over the past few weeks.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley">
   <p>Last week was generally very dry and very cold as an Arctic air mass made its presence known from the U.S.-Canadian border down to the Gulf of Mexico. One area that continues to see steady improvement is in deep southern Texas where contraction continues this week across the D0-D2 pockets scattered about the region. One area that hasn’t shared in the favorable pattern is the southeastern coast of Texas and the southwest corner of Louisiana, where D0 is introduced this week.</p>

  <region name="The West">
   <p>There seems to be no relief in sight as the calendar flips over to 2014. Persistent ridging has kept precipitation at bay for many, leading to record-setting dryness for many locations in California and Oregon; this has become more of an issue of late in Washington as well. Even though California sees no changes on this week’s map, more deterioration could be coming soon given the weather pattern, or lack thereof, and concern for water supply, fire and other impacts grows each week the rains and snows don’t come. In fact, many locations in California reported the calendar year 2013 as being the driest on record, smashing previous record dry years (including 1976). One such example is Shasta Dam, where only 16.89 inches was reported in 2013, more than 11 inches below the previous record low of 27.99 inches in 1976. Shasta’s calendar year average is 62.72 inches. Upper elevation Sierra station snowpack and snow water equivalent (SWE) values in California have been abysmal for the Water Year (since October 1) as well. The historic low precipitation totals haven’t just been confined to the upper elevations either as dozens of locations have shattered their previous record low calendar year totals.</p>
   <p>In the Pacific Northwest, D1 has pushed northward across western Oregon and into western Washington up to the Canadian border this week. Both snow pack and snow water equivalent SWE levels are very low as we move deeper into the wet season. In Idaho, D0 now covers the entire Panhandle and has pushed into more of extreme northwestern Montana. The D3 pockets in southern Idaho have been combined and D3 now stretches across most of the southern part of the state.</p>
   <p>The Southwest has also been dry for the Water Year as the monsoon season is now out of the rear view mirror as we head into the second half of the wet winter season. The resultant lack of precipitation means D0-D2 has expanded slightly in southern and central Arizona as well as in northwestern Arizona, where D2 has pressed southward out of extreme southern Nevada. Southern New Mexico also sees a slight expansion of D1 this week.</p>
