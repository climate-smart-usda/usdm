  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 10-day period that may affect areas experiencing dryness or drought across the country include: 1) several weather systems are projected to affect California during the period, with the latest 6-10 day forecast from the Climate Prediction Center (valid 27 February through 3 March) indicating increased chances for above-normal precipitation for most of the state; 2) the heaviest precipitation from these systems affecting California are projected to stay south of the drought and dry areas in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies; 3) a major storm forecasted to develop in the southern Plains on Friday, 23 February, is expected to track across the Great Lakes and northern New England 24-26 February; 4) heavy snow associated with this storm could be confined to South Dakota and Minnesota, but heavy rains will be widespread across the central part of the country and could help the dry and drought areas in Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and the mid-Mississippi Valley; 5) warm temperatures and seasonable amounts of precipitation are expected across most of the Southeast; and 6) dry conditions are expected to continue across most of Florida through the period, which could intensify the ongoing drought there.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Relatively dry weather returned again to Hawaii during the week after the generous rainfall totals from the week before. It remained dry across the D0 area along the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Central Appalachians">
   <p>Heavy precipitation across West Virginia during the week improved the hydrological drought conditions occurring in the state. Moderate drought (D1) conditions improved to D0 (abnormally dry) across the south, while the D0 area in the northern part of the state was eliminated. Abnormally dry (D0) conditions still exist in western and central Pennsylvania, although precipitation during the week did allow removal of the D0 designation in the southwestern corner of the state.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>A relatively dry week occurred across the central Plains this week with no changes to the drought areas in Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas. In western Texas, reservoirs continue to be a lingering problem. As of 19 February, the Twin Buttes Reservoir and the O.C. Fisher Reservoir near San Angelo were 4.6% and 8.4%, respectively, of conservation storage capacity. Other reservoirs in the D2 (severe drought) and D1 (moderate drought) area range up to 57% of conservation storage capacity. The International Amistad and Falcon Reservoirs along the Rio Grande River continue to slowly improve from last summers low levels. Meanwhile, 59 communities across the state currently have water restrictions to avoid shortages, with a good number of these communities located within the drought and abnormally dry areas in western Texas and the Lower Rio Grande Valley.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Heavy rain (2-6 inches) fell in a large swath from northeast Texas to West Virginia, improving many of the drought and abnormally dry areas within this swath. The severe drought (D2) area centered on Memphis, TN, improved to D1 (moderate drought). The moderate drought (D1) area in western and central Tennessee improved to D0. The abnormally dry classification (D0) was eliminated from parts of southeastern Missouri, eastern Arkansas, northern Mississippi, northern Alabama, and much of Kentucky because of the rainfall.</p>
   <p>In sharp contrast, however, drought deepened across the other drought areas in the Southeast. Much above normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation occurred across Florida, eastern Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. As a result, the extreme drought (D3) area in western North Carolina expanded into parts of Georgia and South Carolina. Lakes Marion and Moultrie, located between Columbia and Charleston, SC, are at record low levels for this time of year. In Florida, wildfires are increasingly becoming a threat, with one fire closing a portion of Interstate 4 between Orlando and Tampa beginning on Saturday night, 17 February (Florida officials will likely keep it closed for another week). On Sunday, the New York Yankees were forced to end their spring training workout in Tampa after only 45 minutes because of the heavy smoke. As of Saturday, 17 February, a total of 1,230 fires had occurred across the state since the beginning of the year, burning a total of 83,150 acres. In southern Florida, precipitation since early October is running about 20% of normal. For the South Florida Water Management District, the district-wide precipitation total for the October 2000 through mid-February 2001 period has been 2.34 inches, which is a departure from average of -9.07 inches!</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Precipitation amounts varied during the week across the West, but the overall situation changed very little from the previous weeks. The precipitation along the California coast north of San Francisco and in south-central California did reduce some of the abnormally dry (D0) conditions in those two locations, and brought seasonal precipitation totals there closer to normal. State-level drought committees met during the week in both Washington and Oregon to discuss the dry conditions and the potential impacts that may occur during the year. For the Columbia River, volume forecasts issued on 15 February are at 61% and 59% of average at Grand Coulee and The Dalles, respectively. The volume observed at The Dalles during the 1977 water year was 51% of average, which is the record low in modern times.</p>
