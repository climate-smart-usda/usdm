  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>For the next 5-day period (January 25-30): 1) The main long-wave pattern will feature a ridge over the west half of the United States and a trough over the east. 2) Precipitation is projected to be greatest over the Gulf Coast and Pacific Northwest. A series of systems will maintain the current wet pattern of the Pacific Northwest, while the Gulf Coast states should see several systems make their way through the region, continuing the recent wet pattern. 3) Temperatures are anticipated to be well above normal for the western two-thirds of the United States and below normal for the eastern United States. Temperatures in Alaska are forecasted to be well below normal as well.</p>
   <p>In the extended period, 6-10 days out (January 31-February 4): 1) Very little change in the long-wave pattern, with ridging dominating the western United States during this time. 2) Temperatures are expected to be well above normal for the High Plains region and southern California. Cooler-than-normal temperatures will be observed in Alaska and along the southeast part of the United States, in accordance with the long-wave trough in the region. 3) Precipitation amounts are forecasted to be below normal for the southern half of the United States and the upper reaches of the High Plains. The Pacific Northwest continues to stay in a very wet pattern, while Alaska should experience continued dryness in the north and above-normal precipitation along the southern coast.</p>

  <region name="Alaska and Hawaii">
   <p>Much of Alaska was dry this last week, with the exception of south-central Alaska. Valdez, AK, received 34.2 inches of snow from one event. This did help to reduce snow and precipitation deficits, but they are still running well below normal.</p>
   <p>Warm conditions persist over Hawaii. Some tradewind rainfalls have helped to reduce some of the dryness over Hawaii. On the Big Island, D0 was reduced on the northern side of the island. Maui, Molokai, and Oahu also saw a reduction of D0 because of recent rains. On Kauai, the D1 was pushed back to just the southern half of the island, leaving D0 conditions behind.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast">
   <p>Significant precipitation events have continued to take place across the region. Common rainfall totals over Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, and eastern Arkansas were in the 2-4 inch range, with some local areas receiving more. This eliminated the D2 area in Kentucky and also reduced the D1 and D0 significantly as well. Longer time frames are still showing dryness in the region, but improvements were widespread.</p>
   <p>The D0 in North Carolina has remained unchanged because of the long-term hydrological issues associated with this area. With water storage being an issue, it may take some time for this part of North Carolina to fully recover.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Midwest">
   <p>Conditions continued to worsen in Missouri. All the drought categories were expanded to include all of west central and southwest Missouri. This area is has received 50% or less of normal precipitation at the 30-, 60-, and 90-day time frames. Joplin, MO, has received 4.07 inches of precipitation since October 1, 2005, which is just 33% of normal. Welcomed precipitation was observed over the northern extent of the region. The defined drought areas saw some relief, but conditions remained unchanged.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southwest">
   <p>The dry pattern continues to plague both New Mexico and Arizona. With the continuing dryness, D2 conditions were expanded to cover more of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. In New Mexico, D1 was expanded to the east, reflecting the continuing dryness in the area. D0 conditions were also expanded to cover all of southeast Utah. The region continues to see low snowfall and precipitation (less than 25% of normal) for the water year, with some stations at or near record low precipitation values at this time. Tucson, AZ, has recorded 0.32 inches of precipitation for the water year, which is 9% of normal.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northwest and Northern Rockies">
   <p>Conditions continued to be favorable for improvement of drought conditions over the region. D0 was pushed farther south in Idaho and to the east in Montana, to the Continental Divide, as precipitation since October 1 has been 150% of normal or more. The region has experienced a significant wet period, and in the long term, hydrologic issues from several years of drought in the region are the only remaining impacts where areas of D0 still exist. D0 was expanded north out of Wyoming and into southern Montana as snowpack and precipitation amounts are well below normal for this time of year.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Dry and unseasonably warm conditions again dominated the Plains, with conditions in the southern plains continuing to deteriorate. Southeast Kansas, central Oklahoma, and central Texas all had an expansion of D0, D1, and D2 conditions as this region has received less than 50% of normal precipitation in the last 90 days. The D4 region south of the Dallas metro area was expanded to the south, as similar conditions here warrant the expansion. The eastern edge of the plains did receive some much-needed precipitation, but the amounts did not relieve the short- and long-term dryness. In Lubbock, TX, January 23 rd marked the 88 th consecutive day without measurable precipitation for that location. This broke the old record set back in 1921-1922.</p>
