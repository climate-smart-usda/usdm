  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 10-day period that may affect areas experiencing dryness or drought across the country include: 1) we can expect to see a cooler and wetter pattern set up across the central Plains and over into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes region over the coming 5 (August 11-15) days. Good rains are forecasted from western Kansas up through southeastern Nebraska, northwestern Missouri, most of Iowa and western Illinois; 2) during the same time frame, below-normal temperatures (3-6 degrees) are expected across most of the Rockies, central and high Plains as cooler Canadian air spills down into the central U.S. behind a strong cold front ; 3) good monsoonal flow is called for across most of Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, right where it is needed most; 4) the forecast for the August 16-20 period shows the favorable cooler and wetter pattern persisting over the mid-section of the country. The likelihood of drier conditions is enhanced in the Pacific Northwest and the Upper Great Lakes region (northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan). The warmth should remain in the Northeast and in the Pacific Northwest as well.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Even with the recent heat and news of fires in Hawaii, it should be noted that this is actually due more to the not-so-long-ago wetness that allowed for good vegetative growth. The recent hot dry spell has resulted in fires having good fuels to burn. That said, abnormally dry (D0) conditions do remain spread across parts of all of the islands.</p>

  <region name="The Central United States">
   <p>Last week brought a mixed bag of weather but the warmth and humidity generally returned in earnest. Most parts of the upper Midwest saw temperatures well above normal (5 to10 degrees warmer) from Missouri over to Kentucky and up into the Great Lakes region. Precipitation was spotty but welcomed in parts of southern Missouri, northeast Ohio and southeast Pennsylvania, where reported totals ranged from 2 to 4 inches in spots. D0 and D1 have now extended into more of the Ohio River Valley and severe drought (D2) has once again leaked into southwestern coastal areas of Michigan from Muskegon, MI, down to Michigan City, IN.</p>
   <p>The drought continues to edge ever so slightly to the west out of Illinois and into eastern Iowa where the gradient between the haves and the have-nots is quite extreme. The rains of the past 30-60 days across the Bootheel and parts of northern Arkansas have led to a breaking of the D2 that had joined them together. However, large areas of drought still remain entrenched as longer periods show significant deficits. Impacts are still widespread with regard to poor crop and pasture conditions in these areas.</p>
   <p>In Nebraska, another generally hot and dry week has led to the slight expansion of D0-D2 across the central and eastern portions of the state. Crops dependent on timely rains are beginning to show some stress here. This same weather pattern has also led to a slight push eastward of the D0 in southern and eastern South Dakota.</p>
   <p>Following on the generally good rains of July in eastern Texas, August is off to a good start in all but extreme southern Texas. Rains have also been above-normal over parts of southern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas since the beginning of August. Most of northern Texas has seen cooler than normal temperatures and 150-200% of normal (+3 to 6 inches) rainfall over the past 30 days. Southern Arkansas hasnt been as fortunate and so conditions there remain unchanged, with the persistent D1-D3 well noted. As for Texas, conditions have improved quite a bit because of these rains across the northern half of the state. General 1-category improvements are noted this week across the area. Abnormally dry (D0) conditions remain across the mid-section of the state because of some lingering longer-term dryness that stretches to the beginning of the year. In Louisiana, the D0 has also spread across the central portion of the state because of recent dryness.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeastern United States">
   <p>In addition to this summers dry spell, well above normal temperatures last week led to a general expansion of abnormally dry (D0) conditions from the Ohio Valley eastward into southern New York and southern New England. The most notable departures can be found in western New York and north central Pennsylvania, where moderate drought (D1) is depicted this week. Departures here are running at 4 to 8 inches (50-70% of normal) for the 90-day period ending August 9. The continuation of rains over the past few weeks has finally put an end to the D0 located along the Virginia-North Carolina border.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Western United States">
   <p>After a slow start, the monsoon presence is now in high gear over most of Arizona with recent rains, cooler weather, and some 200% precipitation surpluses over the past couple of weeks across central and eastern parts of the state. As a result, conditions continue to improve after a banner winter for many parts of the state, and this is shown in a general 1-category improvement and pushing eastward of the D0 and D1 areas in the central and eastern regions. New Mexico and southeastern Colorado havent shared in this good fortune at all, however, and these regions bear watching over the next few weeks. Even though July brought some record dryness to parts of Montana, the general long-term recovery is still progressing at a slow pace. It should be noted, however, that moderate (D1) and severe (D2) drought still remain quite visible (because of the recent warmth and dryness) and another dry winter would send the state back into drought in short order.</p>
