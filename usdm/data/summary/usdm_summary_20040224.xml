  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>In the ongoing battle between the forces of drought and wetness, another series of winter storms is expected to move across the western and central U.S. drought areas. During February 25 - 29, several storm systems will bring widespread wet conditions from the California coast to the Ohio Valley. Particularly, drought areas in the Great Plains and Great Lakes should see some relief with as much as one to two inches of precipitation expected. For the ensuing five days (March 1 - 5), above normal precipitation, along with below average temperatures, are expected in the drought areas from the southern Rockies, across the Plains, to the Great Lakes. In contrast, below average precipitation is forecasted for much of the Far West, and Alaska can expect to see above average temperatures statewide with below average precipitation in the west.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Alaska">
   <p>The southern coastal stations in Alaska received precipitation this week, but the interior stations remained dry. Since D0 was expanded 2 weeks ago to reflect current winter dryness and low snowpacks, no changes were made to the Alaska depiction. Hawaii experienced widespread dryness this week, and abnormally dry conditions still exist on parts of Hawaii and Molokai.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes">
   <p>A few tenths to nearly an inch of precipitation fell this week along the edge of the drought area from Kansas to southern Wisconsin. The D0 was pulled back across central Iowa where the heaviest precipitation occurred. In northeast Wisconsin, D0 and D1 were shaved slightly where 1 to 2 inches of precipitation fell. Lesser precipitation amounts were recorded in the core drought areas, which have seen less than 50% to 80% of normal precipitation in the 6 to 12 month time frames, respectively. The remaining central and northern Plains drought areas received little or no precipitation.</p>
   <p>Rain and snow fell in the southern Plains from west Texas eastward to along the Red River. D0 was pulled back on the Texas side of the river and in northwest Louisiana and southern Arkansas. D1 was contracted slightly in northern Texas and in southwest Oklahoma where over 1 inch of precipitation was measured. No change in the depiction was made to west Texas, where moisture deficits were severe, ranging from less than 70% to 85% of normal precipitation in the 6 month to 5 year time frames, respectively. Just prior to the latest round of storms, on February 19, thick blinding dust storms across eastern New Mexico and west Texas caused a series of traffic accidents that reportedly killed 2 people and injured dozens of others. The dust storms were characterized by strong winds -- near 60 miles per hour -- and low visibility, in places down to 50 feet to half a mile.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies, Southwest, and Far West">
   <p>The storm systems brought widespread areas of light rain and snow to the southwestern states, with a few areas of an inch or more of precipitation. Unfortunately, the amounts were not sufficient to ease the drought conditions in the core drought areas, where significant moisture deficits have built up over the last 5 years. A major winter storm was dumping copious amounts of rain and snow on eastern upslope areas of northern and central New Mexico, and spreading into parts of west Texas, as this weeks Drought Monitor period ended. Since this multi-day event was spanning the time periods of two Drought Monitor maps, no change to the depiction in this area was made on this weeks map. Improvements to the depiction for this event will be portrayed on next weeks Drought Monitor.</p>
   <p>Numerous reports of 2 to 4 inches of precipitation at stations in southern California were accompanied by flooding in the mountains. This prompted the pull back of D0 away from the southern California coast, however many low elevation locations remained dry here over the long-term.</p>
   <p>Very little precipitation fell across eastern Oregon, so no change was made to the southeastern Oregon drought depiction. Klamath County Commissioners recently declared a drought for their county, but the Oregon Cascade Mountains received 1 to 2 inches of precipitation this week, so no change was made to the Klamath area.</p>
   <p>Large areas of 0.5 inch or more of precipitation fell early in the period across the Idaho panhandle and across parts of northwest Wyoming, but little change occurred from last week in water-year-to-date precipitation and snowpack moisture at the high elevation SNOTEL sites, so no changes were made. The Wyoming State Engineers Office placed restrictions on the use of water from the North Platte River in an effort to help fill Pathfinder and Guernsey reservoirs. Guernsey was 35% full, Pathfinder 32% full, and nearby Seminoe Reservoir was 27% full. This part of the state (southeast Wyoming) received very little precipitation this week and snowpack moisture significantly decreased recently, so an arm of the western Nebraska D3 was expanded westward up the North Platte River to capture these Wyoming reservoirs.</p>
