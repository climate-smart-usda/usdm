  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Over the next 10 days, several anticipated developments could impact the nations dry areas, including: (1) Surplus precipitation and subnormal temperatures from the Rockies eastward to the Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley, particularly in Texas and the adjacent southern Plains; (2) Continued dry and warm weather through at least November 6 in the southeastern quarter of the country, except for some light precipitation in the Tennessee and southeastern Mississippi Valleys; (3) Increased chances for beneficial moderate to heavy precipitation from the Mississippi Valley to the Appalachians during November 7 - 11; and (4) Dryness in Florida and warmth throughout the south Atlantic region through the first full week of November.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Long-term dryness and drought continued to affect leeward parts of all islands in Hawaii. Most locations reported only light rain last week, but some heavier rains were noted in eastern Maui, eastern Molokai, and small sections of the leeward Big Island. Still, D2(A,F) continued to cover the leeward sides of Maui and the Big Island, and the western two-thirds of Molokai.</p>

  <region name="The Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes Region">
   <p>In stark contrast to conditions farther east, wet weather which began earlier in the month continued through the last 7 days, bringing widespread drought relief to most of the Plains from northern Texas northward through eastern Colorado and Nebraska. Since October 1, many locations from southern Nebraska and northern Missouri southward to southern and western Texas received over 4 inches of rain, with 12 to 16 inches noted at a few locations in central and southwestern Oklahoma.</p>
   <p>As a result, dryness abated through parts of the central Plains, and many areas from Oklahoma and the southern High Plains northward through Nebraska and Iowa experienced 1-category declines in drought severity. In northern Missouri, southern Texas, western Nebraska, and adjacent sections of Colorado and Kansas, short-term drought indicators improved significantly, but long-term moisture shortages and low reservoir stores continued, leading to D0(W) and D1(W) classifications.</p>
   <p>Areas along the eastern and southern fringes of the region missed most of the rain, resulting in expanded or increased drought intensity for a few locales. Part of interior eastern Texas increased to D2, and D0 was expanded to include southwestern Wisconsin, southeastern Minnesota, northwestern Illinois, and eastern Iowa. These new D0 areas generally received near or less than half of normal precipitation in October, and were 1 to locally 4 inches below normal for the last 90 days.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South and Southeast">
   <p>Drought continued to intensify across the region as only scattered light rains dotted areas south and east of the Ohio and lower Mississippi Valleys. Most locations from central Maryland and Virginia southward through the Carolinas and eastern Georgia recorded little or no precipitation since late September, prompting drought intensification to D2 or D3 across the interior south Atlantic region, and the expansion of D0 into parts of the central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic.</p>
   <p>On October 31, the U. S. Geological Survey reported 45% of streamflow observing sites across Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida among the lowest 10th percentile of historical measurements for the day. Just over a month ago, on September 27, only 5% were similarly low. Also, October 31 marked a record 36th consecutive day without measurable precipitation at Greenville, SC (the previous record was 31 days, ending November 9, 1952). If no measurable precipitation falls on Columbia, SC by the end of November 5, that location would also establish a new record for consecutive days without measurable precipitation (41), with reliable observations dating back to 1887. Furthermore, preliminary data from state climatologists indicated that South Carolina as a whole experienced its driest October (0.01 inches of rain) since records began in 1895, and that Virginia probably endured its driest month for any time of year since records began during the 1870's.</p>
   <p>Long-term precipitation shortfalls, dating back to May 1998 in some areas, exacerbated the effects of the ongoing short-term dryness in much of the region. The Ruskin, FL Weather Forecast Office reported that the 62.55" of rain measured at Tampa, FL for October 1998 - October 2000 was by far their lowest 25-month total since records began in 1891, breaking the prior record of 71.02" for April 1966 - April 1968.</p>
   <p>Farther west, across the central Gulf Coast and lower Mississippi Valley, the dry week kept drought conditions essentially unchanged, though some expansion of D4 into southwestern Mississippi and eastern Louisiana was noted. During August - October, most areas from the lower Mississippi Valley eastward through much of Tennessee and Alabama received at least 4 inches less rainfall than normal, with deficits exceeding 7 inches in central and southwestern Louisiana and the northern reaches of Mississippi and central Alabama. Between 85% and 97% of topsoils were short or very short of moisture across Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana on October 29, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Another relatively wet week brought continued drought improvement to the region. Areas from the northern Intermountain West, the west-central Rockies, and the southern Rockies westward are no longer experiencing mature drought conditions (D1 or worse). However, D1 to localized D3 conditions persisted across central Montana, and D1 actually expanded slightly in sections of northern Colorado.</p>
