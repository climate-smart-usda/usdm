  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <intro>
   <p>The weather pattern during this U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) week (last Tuesday through this Tuesday morning) was a continuation of storm systems embedded in the westerly flow which has characterized much of the month.  The week began with beneficial precipitation falling over the drought areas of the Pacific Northwest and Deep South Texas.  A strong Gulf of Mexico low pressure system brought heavy rain to the Southeast, including the Florida drought areas, and heavy snow in the colder air along the Appalachians to the mid-Atlantic coast.  Another Pacific system moved into the West by the end of the USDM week.</p>
  </intro>
  <forecast>
   <p>Weather systems moving in the westerly flow will bring areas of rain and snow to the country during the next 2 weeks.  Above-normal precipitation is expected along the southern tier states from California to the Mid-Atlantic Coast December 29, 2009-January 2, 2010, with below-normal precipitation forecast for the Ohio Valley to northern Rockies.  The weather systems will drag cooler-than-normal air behind them as they cross the country, while above-normal temperatures are expected over western Alaska.</p>
   <p>For the first week of 2010 (January 1-6), above-normal precipitation is forecast for the Gulf Coast to Mid-Atlantic Coast and much of Montana, with below-normal precipitation on tap for the rest of the West, the central Plains to Ohio Valley, and New England.  An upper-air trough with colder-than-normal air is expected to dominate much of the country, while warmer-than-normal air hugs the Pacific Coast.</p>
   <p>Below-normal precipitation is forecast for Alaska throughout the period.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Eastern Puerto Rico had an inch of rainfall in the last 7 days, but this was still below normal for the week.  The eastern half of the island had a below-normal rainfall pattern with 8+ inch deficits in some areas for the last 60 days and 16 inch deficits in places at 180 days.  Streams in the northeast were low (both current streamflows and those averaged over the last 28 days reflecting baseflow conditions).  An area of abnormal dryness (D0) was added to northeast Puerto Rico over the area having the greatest rainfall deficits and lowest streamflows.</p>
   <p>The impacts designator was changed from AH to H over the Alaska D0 area, to reflect continuing long-term precipitation deficits and below-normal snowpack.  Drought conditions remained unchanged across the Hawaiian Islands.  Recent rains in windward locations elevated streamflow but were not significant enough to change the drought depiction.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Great Lakes Region">
   <p>The drought-affected areas of the region saw no precipitation this week, with continued low streamflows.  Persistent long-term deficits resulted in unchanged drought classification in this region.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>In Deep South Texas, widespread 2-inch-plus rains resulted in the contraction of the severe drought (D2) area to Jim Wells, Nueces, and Kleberg counties and contraction of the D1 and D0 to the south.  Beneficial rains have given this area a precipitation surplus for recent months and soil moisture has recovered.  However, moisture deficits at 9 months to 24 months were significant, with the greatest deficits over the contracted D2 region.</p>
   <p>The last several weeks have been very dry across parts of the southern and northern Plains, especially from the northern Texas panhandle, across northern Oklahoma, to southeastern Kansas.  The dryness has not caused any notable impacts so far in this winter dry season, so no change was made here to this weekâ€™s USDM depiction.  But this area will be monitored closely as the winter progresses.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Widespread rains of 2 inches or more fell across Indian River and St. Lucie counties in Florida, with some isolated reports of 10&quot; or more.  The rain was beneficial in the short-term, but long-term deficits remained over some parts of the Florida drought area.  Moderate drought (D1) was eliminated and the area of abnormal dryness (D0) was reduced.  The remaining D0 was a reflection of longer-term hydrological impacts.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Widespread areas of 2+ inches of precipitation fell over the Pacific Northwest coast this week, but mostly west of the drought areas.  Above-normal precipitation was reported over parts of the northern California drought areas, and over northern Idaho and northwest Montana D0 areas, but the amounts were not significant enough to erase the deficits for the last 30 days and longer so no change was made to the USDM depiction.</p>
   <p>Below-normal precipitation since the beginning of the water year (which started October 1) was widespread across the interior basin from Nevada and Utah to Idaho.  Below-normal mountain snowpack was observed at high elevation SNOTEL stations across this area and into western Wyoming and southern Oregon.  Stream baseflow levels remained low across northern California to parts of Oregon and Washington.</p>
   <p>Snowpack over Arizona was above-normal, but in the Flagstaff area it was melting at a very fast rate.  Precipitation across Arizona was well-below normal for the water year-to-date as well as for the calendar year-to-date, and modeled soil moisture was also dry.  No change was made to the depiction over Arizona this week.</p>
