  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week.

   <p>The onset of a wet pattern in the northwestern U.S. is creating a pause in the development of drought in the western states.  Much of the northern tier states remained unchanged, while the southeast continues to suffer from mounting deficits of precipitation and severe impacts.</p>

  <forecast>
   <p>The outlook is encouraging for snow seekers as a large-scale pattern has finally shifted into a wetter regime for many states over the next several days.  Forecasts are projecting 10-15 inches of rain over the next five days along the Pacific coast of northern California and Oregon.  At least a few feet of snow is possible in the mountain ranges of the northwest states to include the Cascades, Rockies and Sierra Nevada.  Lesser amounts of snow and rain are projected across the eastern half of the Lower 48.  Widespread totals over the five day period could amount to about an inch, with localized areas possibly reporting more than two inches in the southern Appalachians.  Colder than normal temperatures will continue to hold on to Alaska, while warmer than normal temperatures may build over much of the contiguous U.S. by the end of the next U.S. Drought Monitor period.  After a frontal system just affected Hawaii over the last day or so, it appears as if it will be set into a drier trend for the next couple of days, before the next system passes through.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Alaska is one state that has no drought at this time as many locations continue to report record snowfall.  Cities such as Valdez, Anchorage, Juneau, and up into central Alaska have had two to three times their normal snowfall this season, with below average temperatures the last couple of weeks.</p>
   <p>The western slopes of Maui in the state of Hawaii are being affected by reduced rangeland quality and is now in D3, Extreme Drought, up the coast to Lahaina.</p>
   <p>No changes are made to the depiction in Puerto Rico this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Northern Plains and Midwest ">
   <p>No changes were made this week to this northern tier of states from Montana to Pennsylvania.  Temperatures during this U.S. Drought Monitor period remained above the seasonal average.  Scattered light precipitation across the region staved off any further degradation.  A strong system moved through the Ohio River Valley, but as this region was already drought-free on the map, no changes were warranted.  As much as two to three inches of precipitation was reported for the week in parts of central and southern Indiana.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southern and Central Plains">
   <p>A welcome sign of drought relief came in the form of rain to parts of eastern Oklahoma.  A one-category improvement was made along the Canadian River, and south to the Texas border.  Other areas warranted changes in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana, after a review of the last 30 to 45 days of above normal precipitation.  This area is now mostly in D0, Abnormally Dry, conditions.  A small area of southwestern Kansas is degraded this week to D3, Extreme Drought.  Ongoing precipitation deficits and declining vegetation health were motivation for this one-category change.  D0 is also expanded in western Kansas to include Greeley and Wichita counties, and areas just north of there, to account for short-term rainfall deficits.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>Abnormally Dry designation is expanded to include northeastern New York and northern Vermont to reflect lack of snowfall in the region.  A large area of D0 is also introduced to most of Maine as a result of short term below-normal precipitation over the last 30 to 90 days.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic">
   <p>The Southeastern U.S. continues to suffer from shortages of precipitation, extremely low streamflow in area rivers and streams, and increased wildland fire danger.  Despite a small reprieve in northwestern Alabama during this U.S. Drought Monitor period, much of the area is experiencing degrading conditions.  A new area of Exceptional Drought, D4, is introduced to the Alabama-Georgia border to reflect the record low precipitation, streamflow, and other forage impacts.  A one-category downgrade is made across Florida’s northern border and the nearby states of Alabama and Georgia, as deficits and impact reports mount.  Moderate Drought, D1, is expanded from Sarasota to Daytona Beach, Florida.  A new D1 area is introduced in southern Florida counties of Monroe and Miami-Dade as well.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Over most of the western region of the U.S., quiet weather conditions prevailed, but a strong system was beginning to impact the northwest and northern Rockies just as this week’s U.S. Drought Monitor was completed.  As a result, most of the region remained unchanged from the previous map.  Notable exceptions are an expansion of D0, Abnormally Dry, conditions across the remainder of Idaho.  Similarly, much of northwestern Colorado is also designated as D0 from Steamboat Springs in the north to Glenwood Springs and Grand Junction in Interstate 70.  These were motivated by low snowpack values reported this week, as well as some areas beginning to suffer from lower than normal soil moisture conditions.  Water supply reservoirs appear to be at near-normal or above-normal levels, however, with carryover from the previous wet year evident across the region.</p>
   <p>Further south in Arizona, a downgrade to D0 is also made in the northwestern counties of Mohave, Coconino and Yavapai due to short term shortage in precipitation this winter season.  Two areas of improvement are noted in New Mexico, around Las Cruces and west of Albuquerque.  Precipitation over the last two to four weeks in these areas was nearly two inches above normal.</p>
