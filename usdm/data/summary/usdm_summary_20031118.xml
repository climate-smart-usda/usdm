  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>November 20-24, the primary weather highlight in drought-affected areas will be the development of a double-barreled storm system across the northwestern and north-central U.S. Late this week and during the weekend, snow will accompany a return to cold weather across the northern Plains and parts of the Northwest. By early next week, a second round of storminess will provide showers and thunderstorms to the Mississippi Valley and the possibility of snow from the central Plains northeastward into the upper Great Lakes region. The NWS 6- to 10-day outlook for November 25-29 (centered on Thanksgiving Day, November 27) calls for unsettled weather across much of the nation. Early in the period, a snow storm will be winding down across the Great Lakes region, while showers associated with its attendant cold front will sweep through the Midwest, South, and East. Rain showers may linger in the Southeast through Thanksgiving, but mostly dry weather will persist on the Plains. Toward the end of the period, stormy weather will begin to overspread the West.</p>

  <region name="Alaska and Hawaii">
   <p>There were no changes to the depiction in Alaska, where mostly dry weather accompanied a cold outbreak. As a result, abnormal dryness (D0) remained intact across the southeastern part of the mainland. Farther south, a more typical rainfall pattern returned to Hawaii, following an unusually slow start to the wet season. Changes in Hawaii involved the removal of abnormal dryness (D0) from eastern portions of Maui, Molokai, and the Big Island. Glenwood, on the Big Island, netted 9.97 inches of rain for the 8-day period ending the morning of November 18. Elsewhere on the Big Island, Hilo's month-to-date rainfall reached 13.82 inches, 147 percent of the November 1-18 normal.</p>

  <region name="The Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes Region">
   <p>Showers and thunderstorms developed in advance of a cold front on November 17-18 from central Texas northeastward into the Great Lakes region. However, most of the significant rain fell east of the Plains and Great Lakes drought areas. There were some slight reductions in drought coverage in parts of Iowa and northern Illinois, primarily where more than 1 inch of rain fell. Farther south, very heavy rains (2 to 4 inches, with locally higher totals) developed from the Arklatex region eastward into the lower Mississippi Valley, eliminating moderate drought (D1) in Louisiana and reducing the coverage of abnormal dryness (D0). In the Delta, rains were beneficial for pastures and winter grains. In terms of drought impacts, lines were rearranged to account for the fact that there are few agricultural drought concerns in the upper Midwest this time of year. However, agricultural impacts are still evident in winter wheat-producing areas on the Plains, where a significant portion of the crop is poorly established due to the combination of subsoil moisture shortages (long-term drought) and a lack of topsoil moisture (short-term precipitation deficits).</p>
   <p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 19 percent of the nation's winter wheat was rated in very poor to poor condition on November 16, well above 7 percent at this time last year. On the Plains, at least one-fifth of the wheat crop was rated very poor to poor in four of seven major producing states. They were South Dakota (33 percent very poor to poor), Texas (32 percent), Colorado (28 percent), and Montana (22 percent). Due to favorably moist conditions in some heavily cropped areas, Kansas wheat (15 percent very poor to poor) was faring best among the Plains states.</p>
   <p>Year-to-date precipitation remained significantly below normal in nearly all of the drought areas across the Plains and upper Mississippi Valley. Examples from locations in or near extreme drought areas (D3), updated through November 18, include: Lubbock, Texas (50 percent of normal; 8.95 inches below normal); Kansas City, Missouri (71 percent; 10.26 inches below normal); and LaCrosse, Wisconsin (71 percent; 8.71 inches below normal). Many Plains locations have been especially dry during the second half of 2003, including Lubbock, where the July 1 - November 18 rainfall totaled 1.78 inches (19 percent of normal).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and Far West">
   <p>Beneficial precipitation fell across much of the West during the week ending November 18. Despite the widespread valley rains and high-elevation snows, drought relief (as much as one category of improvement) was confined to the northern Rockies and parts of the Southwest, primarily on and south of the Mogollon Rim stretching from central Arizona to westernmost New Mexico. In fact, areas currently affected by extreme to exceptional drought (D3 to D4), located mostly across the Interior Northwest, Great Basin, and Southwest, will need a sustained period of stormy weather into next spring to ensure appreciable relief from multi-year precipitation deficits.</p>
   <p>So far this year (January 1 - November 18), precipitation stood at 3.54 inches (51 percent of normal) in Challis, Idaho, and 4.20 inches (50 percent) in El Paso, Texas. Meanwhile, USDA indicated that a portion of the Northwestern winter wheat crop was suffering from a lack of soil moisture. As of November 16, Oregon's wheat was rated 39 percent very poor to poor.</p>
