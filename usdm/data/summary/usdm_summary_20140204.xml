  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <intro>
   <p>During the past 7-days, the persistent, amplified ridge that had dominated weather conditions across the western contiguous U.S. (CONUS) collapsed, which allowed Pacific storm systems to move  eastward across the region.  Moderate to heavy precipitation (0.5-3.0 inches liquid equivalent, locally heavier) was observed over the higher elevations of the Coastal Ranges, the Cascades, the Sierras, the Bitterroots, the Wasatch, and near the Colorado Front Range. Lower elevations across much of the West generally received light precipitation (0.5-inch or less), including the coastal areas of far southern California. Moderate to heavy precipitation (0.5-3.0 inches liquid equivalent, locally heavier) was also observed across portions of the Midwest, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, southern New England, mid-Atlantic and southern Atlantic Coast states,  Gulf Coast region, Tennessee Valley, Lower Mississippi Valley, and the ArkLaTex region.  Temperatures during the past week were primarily below-normal east of the Continental Divide, and above-normal west of the Divide, though there were a few exceptions. East of the Divide, New England and Florida reported above-normal mean temperatures, while west of the Divide, Washington state was below-normal for the week.</p>
  </intro>
  <forecast>
   <p>During February 6-10, 2014, very heavy precipitation (as much as 7-9 inches, liquid equivalent) is predicted in northern California, and 3-4 inches in western Oregon.  This will go a long way in helping to mitigate some of the drought conditions in these areas, though reassessment of conditions next week will be needed to determine the extent of any potential improvements in the Drought Monitor depiction. Along the Southeast coast including northern Florida, 1.0-1.5 inches of rain is expected during the period which will be beneficial to the small areas of abnormal dryness (D0) in that region. With the exception of 3-4 inches of precipitation anticipated over the central Rockies and Wasatch Range, most other areas of the CONUS can expect a half-inch or less of precipitation within the next 5 days.</p>
   <p>For the ensuing 5-day period, February 11-15, 2014, there are elevated odds of above-median precipitation for most of the northern and eastern Lower 48 states, and the Alaska Panhandle. Probabilities for above-median precipitation rise up to 60-percent in the Pacific Northwest, and 50-percent over the Gulf and Atlantic Coast states. Below-median precipitation is favored for southern California, much of the Southwest and southern Rockies, the central and southern High Plains, and most of Alaska.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>The state of Alaska received relatively little precipitation during the past week, with most sites reporting 0.5-inch or less. Moderate to heavy precipitation (0.5-2.0 inches) fell at only a few locations in the southern Cook Inlet vicinity, and Dutch Harbor in the Aleutians. Though the drought depiction in Alaska was not modified this week, it will be necessary to monitor the extent of significantly reduced snowpack at higher elevations in the southern Panhandle during the next few months. This, of course, will determine the amount of water (snowmelt) available for reservoirs in the late spring and early summer. In Hawaii, recent rain events have been beneficial for the eastern half of the state still in drought.  Moderate to heavy precipitation (0.5-3.0 inches in most areas still in drought, with a few locales in northeastern Maui at or above 5 inches) fell during the past 7-days. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) field reports, improving pasture conditions have been noted across most of Maui and the Big Island. This suggests a 1-category improvement is warranted for most areas. The Kualapuu Reservoir water level (Molokai) has been rising slowly, but to date is not enough to significantly ease water restrictions in this area (hence the D3 area on Molokai remains). Atop Mauna Kea, on the Big Island of Hawaii, a foot of snow was reported during the past week, showing that winter weather is not only confined to the continental U.S. In Puerto Rico, rainfall amounts ranged from 0.5-3.0 inches over the eastern half of the island, and largely a half-inch or less over the western half of the island, though a few spotty locations reported 0.5-2.0 inches of rain. No alterations were deemed necessary to the drought depiction in Puerto Rico.</p>

  <region name="Mississippi Valley">
   <p>With significant precipitation deficits mounting in Louisiana, it was decided to expand abnormal dryness (D0) across nearly all of the state, with the exception of far southeastern Louisiana (Grand Isle vicinity), where ACIS 60-day, 90-day, and 180-day PNPs ranged from 98-128 percent of normal. Moderate drought (D1) was expanded throughout much of central and southern Louisiana. An area of severe drought (D2) was introduced over the southwest part of the state (just west of Vermilion Bay) where precipitation deficits (out through 180-days on AHPS) are more of a concern, and the 60-day Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is -2.08.  For example, AHPS PNPs for the last 90-days range between 25-50 percent of normal. In northwestern and north-central Missouri, significant reductions in public water supply have been noted. One example is Lake Stanberry (a shallow water supply lake in Gentry County in northwestern Missouri), while farm pond levels continued to drop (since the summer) in and around the Cameron area (in Clinton and DeKalb Counties).  The Missouri River near Boonville (Cooper County) was also down substantially. ACIS 30-day and 60-day PNPs ranged between 40-60, and 45-80 percent of normal, respectively. Accordingly, all of Gentry, DeKalb, and Clinton Counties in the northwestern portion of the state were degraded from D0 to D1, while Cooper County (north-central Missouri) was degraded from no dryness to abnormal dryness (D0).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Northeast and mid-Atlantic">
   <p>Despite some areas receiving moderate to heavy precipitation (0.5-3.0 inches liquid equivalent, locally heavier) during the past 7-days, most of the Northeast still has Percent of Normal Precipitation (PNP) values ranging from 25-50 percent of normal for the period (AHPS), with central portions of both New York state and New England (and extreme northwestern Maine) in the 10-25 percent range.  A small area of abnormal dryness (D0) was added to the drought depiction in northwestern Maine, where significant precipitation deficits appear at all time-scales going back at least 180-days (AHPS). Much of the mid-Atlantic region has seen precipitation surpluses out through at least 60 days, though Pennsylvania has not fared so well.  Accordingly, abnormal dryness (D0) was expanded across portions of south-central Pennsylvania. Towards the end of the period, a snowstorm brought anywhere from 3-10 inches of snow (preliminary reports) to the Tri-State area of southeastern New York, northern New Jersey, and Connecticut, beginning only hours after the conclusion of the Super Bowl. East Rutherford, New Jersey, where the game was played, reported 8 inches of snow from this event.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southeast">
   <p>After last week’s introduction of abnormal dryness (D0) to much of northern and northwestern Alabama and northern Mississippi, in response to rapidly deteriorating conditions,  the area received 1.5 inches (or more in some locales) of precipitation.  Given the situation, it was deemed appropriate to remove much (but not all) of the D0 introduced last week. Abnormal dryness (D0) was expanded in southwestern Alabama as far east as Dallas County, based on increasing precipitation deficits.</p>
   <p>In central and southern Florida, widespread 2-4 inch rains fell this week, with generally 1-2 inch rains reported elsewhere across the Peninsula. This rainfall brings the dry season precipitation up to normal for these areas (especially following such a wet summer). The Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) and the wildfire risk improved significantly. These factors prompted the removal of D0 conditions across most of central, and all of southern, Florida.</p>
   <p>In North Carolina, short-term dryness has been the rule after a relatively wet November-December period.  The winter storm that moved across eastern North Carolina last week did not produce sufficient precipitation to warrant the removal of abnormal dryness (D0) from the southeastern Coastal Plain region. No changes were rendered to the drought depiction this week, but a pattern of dryness for the central portion of the state will need to be monitored next week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southern and Central Plains">
   <p>Though light to moderate precipitation (under 2.0 inches) fell over parts of western, far southern, eastern, and northern Texas, many areas received little to no precipitation during the past week (though a few locations in the ArkLaTex region received 2-3 inches of rain).  The precipitation that did fall helped to alleviate some of the short-term dryness. However, reservoirs along the Colorado River, as a whole, are at their lowest level (as a percent of normal) for this time of year ever, as is true of total water storage across the state. These factors prompted a number of 1-category improvements and degradations to the Texas drought depiction. In far western Oklahoma, extreme drought (D3) was expanded northward to include Roger Mills County. The latest precipitation event produced only about a tenth of an inch (radar estimated) from Roger Mills County southward across southwestern Oklahoma.  There were a high number of days in January with extremely low relative humidity, mean temperatures close to normal, and wind. The January PNP was 20 percent of normal for the state as a whole (Mesonet), and the state-wide average precipitation was 0.29-inch. This was the 8th driest January on record. In Kansas, the state-wide average precipitation (PNP) for January was only 34 percent of normal. Reassessment of conditions will be needed next week after this current storm system passes through the area. In south-central Nebraska, a small drought-free area was downgraded to abnormal dryness (D0), in response to continuing dryness.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southwest">
   <p>Most of Arizona and New Mexico received little if any precipitation during the past 7-days. A predominantly dry pattern has been in place since the very beneficial and welcome late-season monsoon rains last September. Impacts are somewhat limited at this time due to lower evapo-transpiration (ET) rates during winter, but an increased snowpack in the next two months is needed to preclude more serious problems. SNOTEL Snow Water Equivalent (SWE), as of February 5, 2014, is mostly well below normal across the Mogollon Rim area (ranging from 14-41 percent), and in the White Mountains of eastern Arizona (SWE 26-36 percent of normal). The mountainous terrain of western and central Colorado received moderate to heavy precipitation (0.5-4.0 inches) during the past week, while the high plains of eastern Colorado generally received less than a half-inch of precipitation. As time is needed to evaluate regional impacts across the Southwest, it was decided not to alter the depiction this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Though several inches of precipitation (liquid equivalent) fell over the northern one-half to two-thirds of California this week (locally 3-4 inches in the central Sierras), significantly more precipitation will be needed to justify improvement with the depiction.  The central and southern Sierras report up to 4 inches of SWE, while the northern Sierras report only an inch. The precipitation received this week only keeps the snowpack/water supply from falling further behind. Reservoirs continue to go down. An 8-station index for the northern Sierras (which represents an average of 8 precipitation gauges that span the area from Lake Tahoe to up above Lake Shasta), indicates precipitation amounts of 4.5 inches since the beginning of the Water Year (Oct 1). Last year at this time, 34.3 inches of precipitation fell, while the average to date is 26.4 inches. The only change to the depiction in California this week was to slightly increase the coverage of exceptional drought (D4) conditions across most of San Luis Obispo County. Two of the larger reservoirs in the County, near the border with Monterey County, are at 5-percent capacity (Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio). The City of Cambria is implementing water restrictions for residents, while many cattle owners are selling off their herds due to lack of feed and water. The higher elevations of western Washington and western Oregon received 2-5 inches of precipitation (liquid equivalent, locally heavier) during the past week, though as is the case with California, significantly more precipitation will be needed to overcome longer-term deficits. Finally, in western Montana, the valley areas have been fairly dry recently, while the mountainous areas have received significant precipitation. Given support from the latest short-term and long-term drought blends, and the recent dryness (ACIS 30-day and 60-day PNPs ranging from about 20-50 percent of normal in this area), the drought-free area in southwestern Montana was downgraded to abnormal dryness (D0).</p>
