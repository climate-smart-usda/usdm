  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During July 3 - 8, heavy precipitation is forecast to bring some degree of drought relief to southern Texas and much of Peninsular Florida. Meanwhile, moderate rain should bring more limited relief to much of the Southeastern drought region, and to parts of the west-central Plains. Only light precipitation, if any, is anticipated in other area of dryness and drought across the contiguous 48 states. The ensuing five days look to be warmer than normal across almost the entire 48 contiguous states. The odds favor wetness in the southeastern half of Texas, the Gulf Coast states, much of New England, and New Mexico and adjacent locales. Farther west, seasonably dry conditions are expected to prevail.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Both Hawaii and Puerto Rico received at least light rain last week, enough to keep dryness and drought essentially intact. One exception came on the Big Island of Hawaii, where D2 conditions were assessed this week in the northern reaches, with D1 extending southward into the interior southern sections of the Island.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Texas and New Mexico">
   <p>This was one of the few areas of dryness and drought that received substantial, drought-easing precipitation last week, though there were a few notable exceptions. Anywhere from 1 to several inches of precipitation induced 1-classification improvements for sizeable portions of Texas and eastern New Mexico. Amounts were quite heavy in a few isolated areas, most notably across inland areas near the far southeastern Texas coast, and at a few sites along the Rio Grande River in and near Val Verde County. In most areas, however, precipitation totals were less impressive (between 0.5 and 2.0 inches), and most of south-central and far southern Texas recorded little or no rainfall.</p>
   <p>The resulting improvement from last week's Drought Monitor depiction was substantial and quite widespread, but there were no large-scale areas of dramatic improvement. Two-classification improvements were restricted to fairly small areas in eastern Pecos, Crockett, and the western portions of Schleicher and Sutton counties.</p>
   <p>In stark contrast, another dry week across south-central and far southern Texas continued the trend observed in this region for approximately the last half of the year. Though dryness has not been exceptionally long-lived, the exceptional lack of precipitation during this period led to widespread D3 conditions throughout the area, with a new area of exceptional drought (D4) introduced in upper southern Texas, covering most or all of the counties of Bexar, Wilson, Guadalupe, Comal, Hayes, Caldwell, Gonzales, northern sections of Karnes and DeWitt, Bastrop, the southern reaches of Lee and Travis, Fayette, Lavoca, and Colorado.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Central Plains and Upper Midwest">
   <p>While severe weather and flooding rainfall continued to pound already-water-logged sections of the middle Mississippi Valley, precipitation remained elusive across the central High Plains. However, enough fell to remove D0 conditions from northeastern North Dakota, and to reduce the extent of D0 to D2 conditions from extreme eastern Montana eastward through the central Dakotas. Farther south, less robust precipitation fell from western North Dakota southward to the northern Texas Panhandle, keeping last week's D0 to D4 conditions intact, with the most severe conditions impacting areas across and adjacent to the Oklahoma Panhandle.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>Moderate rainfall (0.5 to 2.0 inches) was fairly widespread across the abnormally dry areas of the Northeast, alleviating dryness where the heavier precipitation fell and reducing the extent of D0 conditions elsewhere. Pockets of abnormal dryness persisted in parts of interior southeastern New York, northeastern Pennsylvania and adjacent New Jersey, and the southernmost reaches of New England.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Although moderate rainfall was fairly common across the area afflicted by dryness and drought, the scattered nature of the precipitation, in conjunction with the long-term nature of the precipitation shortages across the region, led to little discernable relief from the protracted dry spell. In fact, an increase in the coverage was noted in the D1 to D3 areas that recorded less rainfall than most other parts of the region. Exceptional drought (D4) conditions expanded southeastward to cover a bit more of central South Carolina, and D1 to D3 conditions expanded eastward to cover increased areas along the south Atlantic Seaboard, especially across North Carolina. Farther west, D0 to D2 conditions expanded to cover much of Mississippi, all of western Alabama, and some of the central sections of Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>
   <p>Farther south, the rainy season seems to have gotten underway in earnest across central and southern Florida. Drought conditions (D1 to D2) are now constricted to areas around and near Lake Okeechobee, and abnormally dry (D0) conditions pulled out of a significant section of central Florida.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Seasonably dry conditions dominated the western states, resulting in little change in the drought status.</p>
