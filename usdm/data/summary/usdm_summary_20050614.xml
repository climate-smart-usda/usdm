  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 10-day period that may affect areas experiencing dryness or drought across the country include: 1) remnants from Arlene provided northern New England with some heavier precipitation June 14; 2) showers are going to continue across New England June 15-19; 3) an area of organized convection is anticipated to form in the southern Plains and move into the lower Mississippi Valley June 15-16, and although the expected track is unknown, some potential relief could occur in parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, northeast Texas, and Louisiana; 4) a storm system is expected to bring wet weather to the Pacific Northwest June 17-19, and a trough will continue to keep precipitation chances higher in this region June 20-25; 5) a ridge is expected to develop across the Plains, bringing warmer and drier weather to most of the Plains and Midwest June 18-25; 6) the exception to this being in the northern Plains and northern Midwest, where systems could provide some relief June 18-25; and 7) the trades are expected to be active across Hawaii June 16-23, increasing precipitation chances for the windward sides of the islands during this period.</p>
  </forecast>
  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>The windward side of Hawaii saw some relief with an increase in trade winds during the week, but the rest of the state remained mostly dry. No changes were made to the drought and dryness depictions.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest">
   <p>Heavy precipitation resulting from the remnants of Arlene moved north from Kentucky into Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan June 12-13, allowing for widespread improvements in the moderate drought (D1) and abnormal dryness (D0) in these locations. In addition, thunderstorms during the week not associated with Arlene led to improvements in both D1 and D0 across parts of Missouri and western Illinois as well. However, continued dryness caused the expansion of D0 into west-central Wisconsin and northeast Iowa. La Crosse, WI, on the edge of this new D0 area, had a precipitation departure of -3.19 inches below the normal since March 1. Moderate drought (D1) conditions also expanded across the eastern half of Michigans Upper Peninsula, as well as parts of northern Illinois and southeast Wisconsin. Meanwhile, severe drought (D2) conditions expanded into a small area of south-central Missouri during the week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>Beneficial precipitation fell across western New York and northern Pennsylvania during the week, providing some relief to the abnormally dry (D0) conditions being experienced there. Meanwhile, dry weather continued in southern New England, prompting the expansion of D0 across northern New Jersey, southern New York, western Massachusetts, and most of Connecticut.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>The recent wet pattern across much of the central and northern Plains continued during the week. Improvements in both short-term and long-term conditions occurred in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado. In western Nebraska, severe drought (D2) was removed from the region around Lake McConaughy along the North Platte River. This major reservoir is still only at 37% of capacity; it has seen some recent recovery and is slightly above its level at this time last year.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South">
   <p>Tropical Storm Arlene moved onshore June 11 near Mobile Bay, AL, and its remnants provided heavy rains that helped abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate drought (D1) in northeastern Mississippi and western Tennessee, before moving north into the Midwest. The precipitation gradient in this area is steep: Jackson, TN, has received 6.59 inches of precipitation so far in June, and is almost normal for year-to-date precipitation, but Memphis, TN, 60 miles southwest of Jackson, has only received 1.14 inches in June and is 7.75 inches below normal for the year. Elsewhere across the South, heavy precipitation fell from the Texas Panhandle to southern Kansas and in southern Louisiana, improving D0 and D1 in those locations. In fact, in Oklahoma, 9 Mesonet stations in the northwest part of the state received more rain in the 100 hours ending June 13 than in the previous 100 days. Additional precipitation in central North Carolina also helped remove the D0 in that area. Meanwhile, dryness continued to cause conditions to deteriorate across most of Arkansas, as well as eastern and southern Texas. For example, in south-central Arkansas, El Dorado has developed a year-to-date precipitation deficit of more than 9 inches. Texarkana, AR, is only 19% of normal precipitation since May 1. Yearly precipitation in Brownsville, TX, has only totaled 2.79 inches (a departure from normal of -5.12 inches).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Montana saw a continuation of wet weather for the week and, as a result, improvements were made in the D1, D2, and D3 levels across the state. The D0 category now exists for some locations in the eastern part of the state. In Wyoming, assessment of the long-term hydrological conditions in the northeast part of that state led to the removal of extreme drought (D3) in this area. Reservoir levels continue to be low in northeast Wyoming, and actually lag the early June levels in 2004. This is the first time since June 26, 2001 (206 consecutive weeks!), that Wyoming has not had D3 within the state. Assessments of the long-term hydrological conditions also led to improvements to the D1 and D2 areas in southeast Oregon and across southern Idaho. Streamflows at, or near, record low levels, however, prompted the expansion of D0 into northwestern Washington.</p>
