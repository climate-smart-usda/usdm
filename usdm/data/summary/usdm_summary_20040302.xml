  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During March 4 - 7, Moderate to heavy precipitation is expected across the northwestern Rockies, the northern Intermountain West, the southern half of the Great Plains, the middle Mississippi Valley, and the western Great Lakes. More than 1 inch is forecast for northeastern Oregon, central and northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, the Yellowstone region, and in a swath from near the Texas / New Mexico border northeastward through most of Oklahoma, central and eastern Kansas, southeastern Nebraska, all but northwesternmost Iowa, far southeastern Minnesota, and central Wisconsin. Excessive rains (3 to 5 inches) could be on tap for the southeastern half of Oklahoma and the middle Red River of the South Valley. Elsewhere, light to moderate amounts should fall on southeastern Idaho, southwestern Montana, the remainder of western Wyoming, the southern Rockies and High Plains, and the upper Mississippi Valley. Other areas should expect less than 0.25 inch. Much drier weather is forecast for the ensuing 5 days (March 9 - 13), with odds favoring above-normal precipitation limited to the southern Rockies, the southwestern half of Texas, and the southern two-thirds of Alaska. In contrast, below-normal precipitation appears likely for a broad area extending from the West Coast and Great Basin eastward through the central and northern Rockies and High Plains, and in the Great Plains from the Dakotas southward through Oklahoma. In addition, warmer-than-normal conditions are expected for all current areas of dryness and drought in the contiguous United States except along the Texas Gulf Coast.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Alaska">
   <p>Continued abundant precipitation brought an end to the last vestiges of D0 conditions in Hawaii. Farther north, less than 0.4 inch of precipitation fell on the abnormally dry area in central and southeastern Alaska, keeping conditions intact.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and Western Great Lakes">
   <p>The heaviest precipitation in many months was recorded across central and southeastern New Mexico and much of northern Texas south of the Texas Panhandle, where 1 to 3 inches fell. Heavy precipitation also occurred farther to the east, with 3 to 6 inches common across north-central Texas, and 1 to 3 inches falling on the remainder of northern Texas and parts of southern Oklahoma. This moisture eliminated dryness across northern Texas east of the Panhandle and south of the Red River Valley, and brought substantial improvement to other parts of the region. Most areas improved by 1 classification category, and amounts were sufficient to justify a 2-category improvement from southeastern New Mexico eastward to the Wichita Falls, TX area. However, even though neither 30- nor 90-day precipitation totals are as much as an inch below normal anywhere in the region, substantial long-term precipitation shortfalls remain from west-central Texas westward, with corresponding reduced levels of deep soil moisture and low reservoir storages. Thus, though conditions substantially improved, drought remains an ongoing concern across the southwestern Plains.</p>
   <p>Farther north, moderate to heavy precipitation (up to 2 inches) fell on the southern Texas Panhandle, adjacent Oklahoma, northern Kansas, south-central and eastern Nebraska away from the Missouri River, northeastern Colorado, parts of the Nebraska Panhandle, southern South Dakota, and the Black Hills. As a result, 1-category drought classification improvements were assessed near the Black Hills (to D0), in central South Dakota (to D1 or D2), central Nebraska and north-central Kansas (to D1), adjacent parts of eastern Nebraska and areas along the eastern Nebraska/Kansas border (to D0), part of south-central Nebraska (to D2), and far northeastern Colorado (to D2). Light precipitation across the rest of the Plains, upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes generally kept last weeks dryness and drought classifications intact, with 1-category drought intensification (to D3) noted in the northwestern Texas Panhandle and adjacent sections of New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado. This was the only part of the country where drought intensified last week.</p>
   <p>At this time, 90-day precipitation totals more than an inch below normal are not affecting any of the dryness or drought regions in the Plains or upper Midwest, but longer-term precipitation totals remain below- to well-below-normal, so dryness and drought continue to impact these regions to varying degrees of intensity.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and Interior West">
   <p>As was the case farther east, substantial and beneficial precipitation fell on many locations from the Rockies to the West Coast states. However, deficient precipitation has impacted much of this region for several years now, and accumulated long-term deficits remain quite large in many areas, equaling more than a typical years worth of rainfall in some places. As a result, drought improvement was not as widespread as one might expect given the amount of precipitation that fell.</p>
   <p>Between 2 and 5 inches of precipitation fell on north-central and southwestern Utah, north-central and southwestern Colorado, parts of north-central and west-central Wyoming, part of east-central Nevada, and a few sites across southern Nevada, central Arizona, and southeastern Idaho. This resulted in 1-category drought improvements for southwestern Utah (to D3), far southeastern Idaho (to D2 or D3), east-central Nevada (to D2), and southwestern Colorado (to D0). However, the heavy precipitation was not sufficient to substantially improve conditions in Arizona and Wyoming, where D2 conditions remained unchanged.</p>
   <p>In other parts of the interior West, scattered 1- to 3-inch precipitation totals were fairly common, and justified a 1-category improvement across northeastern Nevada (to D1), southern Utah and adjacent Nevada (to D2 or D3), parts of northwestern Arizona (to D2), northwestern New Mexico (to D1 or D2), east-central Idaho (to D2), and part of south-central Idaho and adjacent Nevada (to D1). Other parts of the West remained as they were classified last week despite scattered moderate precipitation. Dryness was completely alleviated only in part of south-central Oregon and adjacent California, and across interior southwestern California.</p>
   <p>Mountain snowpack, which is a crucial source of potable water for much of the western United States, remains near- to above-normal for much of the West as of March 2. The largest surpluses were noted across southern Oregon, northern Nevada, and part of central Utah, where snow water equivalent ranged from 125% to 148% of normal for the date. Meanwhile, amounts below 90% of normal for the date were restricted to the ranges in north-central Washington, most of northwestern Wyoming, much of western and southeastern Wyoming, the eastern half of Colorado, and the southern Rockies outside northwestern New Mexico. Potentially, this is good news for the parts of the West facing record or near-record low reservoir storages, but a lot of variables could adversely affect how much of the current snowpack ends up in some reservoir following the spring snowmelt season, including precipitation for the next 1 or 2 months, the rapidity of the snowmelt, and the proportion of melted snow absorbed by drought-parched soils. Thus, while the stage is set for improved drought conditions and reservoir storages a couple of months from now, this is far from a certainty, and drought remains a critical concern through most of the interior West. As of March 1, 2004, reservoirs across Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico held only 38% to 43% of their typical contents for this time of year, down from 44% to 56% of normal at this time in 2003. During this 1-year period, only Colorado reported a substantial increase in reservoir contents, growing from 55% of normal on March 1, 2003 to 77% of normal on March 1, 2004, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service.</p>
