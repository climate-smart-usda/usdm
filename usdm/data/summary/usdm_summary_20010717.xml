  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the coming days or weeks that may affect areas experiencing dryness or drought include: 1) A broad upper-level ridge is forecast to persist into next week across the south-central U.S., maintaining hot, mostly dry conditions in much of Oklahoma, Texas, and adjacent areas; 2) The ridge may shift westward into the Four Corners region by the end of July, taking the most intense heat with it; 3) Widespread showers and thunderstorms will continue to rotate clockwise around the northern and eastern edges of the ridge into next week, maintaining a ring of fire pattern across portions of the northern Plains and Midwest; 4) During the next several days, a cold front is forecast to interact with abundant moisture across the South, generating scattered thunderstorms that may be locally heavy across Floridas peninsula; 5) Only isolated showers are forecast to accompany below-normal temperatures into next week across the Great Basin and Northwest; 6) The NWS 6-10 day outlook for July 24-28 indicates that above-normal temperatures will prevail in a broad area centered on Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, extending as far west as the Four Corners region, as far north as the Dakotas, and as far east as the lower Ohio Valley. Mostly dry weather will prevail from the central and southern Plains to the southern Atlantic Coast, but near- to above-normal rainfall will help to offset the effects of very warm weather in the Intermountain West, northern Plains, and Midwest. Cool, wet weather is expected in New England.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Widespread showers returned to Hawaii, providing limited relief from long-term drought. In some areas, rainfall deficits have been accumulating for more than 3 1/2 years. Despite recent showers in Puerto Rico, abnormally dry (D0) conditions persist across extreme northeastern portions of the island. Through July 16, San Juans year-to-date rainfall totaled 19.31 inches (84 percent of normal).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest">
   <p>Abnormal dryness (D0) was added in two broad areas across the Midwestern and Great Lakes States due to significant short-term dryness dating to around June 20. Topsoil moisture has diminished rapidly in these areas, and dryness is beginning to adversely affect pastures and summer crops. LaCrosse, Wisconsin, completed a 25th consecutive day without measurable rainfall (starting June 22) on July 16. However, scattered showers and thunderstorms returned to the northern Corn Belt around mid-month, ending LaCrosses streak (0.50 inch fell there on July 17).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>Heavy rainfall (locally in excess of 2 inches) eliminated an area of abnormal dryness (D0) across western Maine and northern portions of Vermont and New Hampshire. Less than 1 inch fell, however, in much of eastern Maine, allowing long-term precipitation deficits and a small area of moderate drought (D1) to persist.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>A severe heat wave continued on the southern Plains, allowing severe drought (D2) to expand across western and northern Texas and edge into southwestern Oklahoma and southeastern New Mexico. Abnormal dryness or moderate drought (D0 or D1) expanded elsewhere in the south-central U.S. Significant rain last fell on much of the southern High Plains in late May, allowing the streak without measurable rainfall in Wichita Falls, Texas, to reach 48 days (May 31 - July 17). According to USDA on July 15, the percent of the cotton crop rated in very poor to poor condition stood at 43 percent in Oklahoma and 37 percent in Texas. Sorghum rated 41 percent very poor to poor in Texas and 37 percent in New Mexico, while peanuts rated 29 percent very poor to poor in Oklahoma and 20 percent in Texas.</p>
   <p>Farther north, widespread rainfall led to a slight reduction of abnormal dryness (D0) on the central High Plains. Weekly rainfall locally exceeded 2 inches in northeastern Colorado, western Kansas, and southwestern Nebraska, easing the effects of recent heat and dryness. Cheyenne, Wyoming, netted a daily-record rainfall of 1.57 inches on July 13, boosting its July 1-17 total to 2.76 inches (232 percent of normal). Meanwhile, conditions improved slightly on the northern High Plains, where hot weather helped to offset the effects of beneficial rainfall. For example, near the edge of the extreme drought area (D3) in north-central Montana, Havre received 2.15 inches of rain (256 percent of normal) from July 1-17, but also noted daily-record high temperatures of 102 degrees F on July 9 and 100 degrees F on July 11.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast and Mid-South">
   <p>Heavy rain soaked much of Florida during the week ending July 17, further easing long-term, hydrological drought across the peninsula. Only a small area of extreme drought (D3) lingers across interior central Florida. During the first 17 days of July, rainfall in former D3 areas included 9.28 inches (225 percent of normal) in Orlando. The average surface elevation of southern Floridas Lake Okeechobee climbed to 9.66 feet on July 17, up from 9.23 feet on July 10 and a record-low level of 8.97 feet on May 23. Farther north, light to moderate rainfall (locally up to 1.5 inches) dampened the southern Appalachians moderate to extreme hydrological drought (D1 to D3) areas in the western Carolinas and extreme northeastern Georgia. Due to mostly dry weather (less than 2 inches of rain) during the last month, an area of abnormal agricultural dryness (D0) was added to portions of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Meanwhile, weekly rainfall totaled generally less than 0.5 inch in the Missouri Bootheel and environs, where a pocket of severe drought (D2) persists.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Monsoonal showers were largely confined to the Four Corners region, but briefly spread into parts of Oregon, Idaho, and northern Nevada. The showers in the Northwest had little effect on long-term drought, which remains extreme (D3) in parts of southern Oregon, northern Nevada, northeastern California, and western Wyoming, but temporarily eased irrigation demands. In addition to existing hydrological concerns in the Northwest, agricultural and wildfires concerns are increasing. As of July 15, USDA indicated that 52 percent of Washington ranges and pastures were in very poor to poor condition, along with 46 percent in Wyoming, 41 percent in Oregon, 39 percent in Nevada, and 32 percent in Idaho. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, there were more than a dozen large wildfires burning in the Northwest on July 17, including six in Utah, six in Idaho, four in Washington, and three in Oregon. One fire, near Promontory, Utah, northwest of Salt Lake City, consumed more than 30,000 acres. In Alaska, cool, showery weather prevailed in southern areas, but a lingering area of abnormal dryness (D0) lingered farther north. Topsoil moisture in the Tanana Valley was rated 40 percent short on July 15, up from 20 percent the previous week.</p>
