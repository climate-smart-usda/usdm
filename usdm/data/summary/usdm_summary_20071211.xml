  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Over the next 5 days (December 13-17), temperatures are expected to remain below normal for almost the entire United States.  The coldest temperatures should be over the Rocky Mountains, Central Plains, and New England, where temperatures will be 6-9 degrees Fahrenheit below normal.  The exception is in the Southeast, where unseasonal warm temperatures will continue.  Temperatures are projected to be 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit above normal through Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.  Precipitation is expected to be greatest over the Tennessee to Ohio River Valley regions and up into southern New England.  Precipitation amounts of 3-4 inches in the Pacific Northwest and 2 inches in south Florida are also forecasted.</p>
   <p>The 6-10 day outlook (December 18-22) is dominated by a strong trough that is projected to extend from Alaska down the west coast of the United States.  Temperatures are expected to be well below normal through all of Alaska and portions of southern California.  Below normal precipitation is projected for much of Alaska compared to well above normal precipitation through most the western United States.  Slight ridging is expected over the Plains, Midwest and Gulf Coast with above normal temperatures.  Below normal precipitation is expected over the northern Plains, with above normal precipitation in the southern Plains and into the Ohio River Valley and New England, where the storm tracks are expected to occur.  Below normal precipitation will continue to hamper the drought conditions in the Southeast during this period as well.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Heavy rains took place in Hawaii this week, with more than 12 inches recorded in some locations.  D0 was removed from Oahu and a categorical improvement was made to the drought conditions on Maui. D1 on the Big Island was also improved to D0.  Alaska was dry except for along the southern coastal regions, and Puerto Rico had widespread precipitation.  No changes in Alaska or Puerto Rico this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast and Ohio Valley">
   <p>An active weather pattern has allowed for improvements in this region.  In Indiana, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, D0 was removed completely.  A categorical improvement in drought status was made in the Kentucky, West Virginia, and Ohio regions.  In the last week, widespread precipitation amounts of 2 inches were recorded in many of the abnormally dry areas, allowing for the improvements.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Midwest">
   <p>An early winter ice storm left many residents of Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska in the dark this week.  Widespread power outages along with downed trees were common through these states.  The precipitation allowed for the improvement of drought status in Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Texas, and Arkansas.  These areas for the most part were abnormally dry (D0), but the D1 in Missouri and Illinois was also reduced.  With the impact of this moisture not completely known at this time, further improvements may be in order as the ice melts.</p>

  <region name="The Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic States">
   <p>A dry and warm week over much of the Southeast has led to the intensification of drought categories in the region. Many locations in the Southeast are on pace to have the all-time driest year on record, with many stations having histories back to the 1880 time period. Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is currently 30.37 inches below normal precipitation for the year.  In Georgia and South Carolina, a categorical shift of all drought categories toward the south and east took place this week. In Florida, continuing impacts due to drought are being experienced throughout the central and southern portions of the state.   Mandatory water restrictions are in place to help conserve water in the region.  D0, D1 and D2 conditions expanded to the north to now include almost the entire Florida peninsula.  D3 conditions were introduced to the north and west of the Lake Okeechobee region this week as well.</p>
   <p>Drought conditions in North Carolina continue to worsen, with many reports of wells going dry in the state.  Many locations are expected to have driest or near driest years on record throughout the state.  Raleigh-Durham had the driest November on record with 0.48 inches, with records back to 1944.  In the Raleigh area, there are only 3 other drier November periods, with the driest coming in 1890 and 1931 with just 0.06 inches recorded on those dates.  Of the 628 water systems being tracked, 173 have mandatory water conservation measures in place, while 162 have voluntary restrictions in place.  D3 and D4 conditions were expanded in North Carolina this week in response to the continued drought conditions and impacts.</p>
   <p>Due to a series of storm systems impacting the region, the D0 and D1 conditions in Maryland and Virginia were pushed farther to the south this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Several storm systems in the region helped to improve conditions in portions of the West.  Much-needed snow and rain was observed in almost every state in the region, boosting snow totals to near normal for this time of year and improving precipitation deficits in many locations.  In Arizona, D0 and D1 conditions were shifted toward the west as several inches of rain fell in the Maricopa County region.  Phoenix Sky Harbor airport recorded 1.02 inches of rain for this week.  In Colorado, heavy snows in the San Juan Mountains helped to edge the D0 conditions out of this region in southern portions of the state.</p>
