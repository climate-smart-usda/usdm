  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <intro>
   <p>A strong upper-level low pressure system moved through the central and eastern United States during the week.  In the Rocky Mountains, wet snow was recorded; on the Plains and eastward, many areas had rain.  The greatest amounts were over east Texas, eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas and into the Ohio River Valley, where up to 5 inches of rain was measured at several locations.  As the system tracked east, areas of the Mid-Atlantic to southern New England recorded 2-3 inches of rain, with locally greater amounts.  During this time, much of the West, the northern Plains, much of the Southeast, the upper Midwest, and northern New England remained dry.  Those areas that received the precipitation were also cooler than normal for the week, with departures of up to 12 degrees below normal over the High Plains and Rocky Mountains.  Warmer than normal temperatures were recorded over much of the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast.</p>
  </intro>
  <forecast>
   <p>Over the next 5-7 days, temperatures are expected to be above normal over the eastern half of the United States with departures of 6-9 degrees above normal over the Southeast.  The Pacific Northwest and northern Rocky Mountains also should see above-normal temperatures with departures of up to 12 degrees above normal.  Cooler than normal temperatures are projected over the central Rocky Mountains into the Southwest with departures of 3-6 degrees below normal.  Another active week appears likely as several storm systems develop over the West and eject out onto the Plains and move into the Northeast.  Precipitation amounts are forecast to be greatest over the northern Rocky Mountains with amounts up to 5 inches over Wyoming.  On the Plains, up to 3 inches are projected in portions of Missouri and east Texas while amounts of over 3 inches are expected in portions of the Mid-Atlantic.  Most of the Great Basin, New England, and the Florida peninsula are forecast to receive widespread precipitation as well.</p>
   <p>The 6-10 day outlooks show that the chances for above-normal temperatures are greatest over the East Coast, West Coast, and Great Basin as well as Alaska, while the best chances for below-normal temperatures will be over the northern and southern Plains.  Forecasts show that the best chances for above-normal precipitation will be from the central and southern Plains to the East Coast.  Chances for below-normal precipitation are best over the upper Midwest and Pacific Northwest.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>For Hawaii, trade wind showers have helped improve drought conditions along the northern portions of Oahu and the Big Island this week.  On Oahu, the gradient of drought and no drought tightened through the island while on the Big Island, a category improvement was made along the north.  The leeward slopes continue to have below-normal precipitation and are where the worst drought areas currently exist; for some farmers, the damage is already done.  The USDA recently declared Hawaii and Maui counties disaster areas.  Substantial rain over all of Puerto Rico allowed for a full category improvement this week.  Rain totals were over 6 inches in the eastern and northwest portions of Puerto Rico while much of the central portions had over 2 inches.  This is in stark contrast to last May when water rationing had already began, and now the reservoirs are full.  No changes were made in Alaska this week.</p>

  <region name="High Plains and South">
   <p>Dryness continued over much of North Dakota, but no additional degradations were made this week.  It was a wet week over much of South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Texas Panhandle.  Cooler than normal conditions and slow-moving rain events allowed for improvements in the region.  A full category improvement was made to the moderate drought and abnormally dry conditions for much of Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and central Arkansas.  Improvements were made in Oklahoma, where most areas saw a full category improvement and severe drought was eliminated. Much of the Texas Panhandle also had a full category improvement.  Abnormally dry conditions were expanded slightly in west Texas and several areas of Texas were identified as areas to watch in the next several weeks for degradation if rains don’t materialize.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Midwest">
   <p>Much of the Midwest recorded above-normal precipitation this week, with the greatest amounts over Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois.  It was dry over much of the upper Midwest with most of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and northern Michigan below normal for precipitation this week.  The wet pattern over Missouri and Illinois during the last several weeks allowed for improvements to the abnormally dry conditions over western Illinois and into eastern Missouri as well as northwest Missouri. Even with deficits existing for the calendar year, many of these deficits occurred during the winter and the recent pattern has allowed for improvements.  Much of Kentucky had deficits that developed over the last several months, and this rain helped to turn the tide and bring much-needed moisture to the state.  For this week’s map, improvements were made to the abnormally dry and moderate drought conditions where the most rain occurred and the indicators supported it.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southeast">
   <p>It was a dry week from Florida into Georgia, Alabama, and central Tennessee while much of the area from eastern Tennessee into the Carolinas recorded above-normal precipitation, with the greatest amounts over central North Carolina and north central South Carolina where departures were up to 5 inches above normal.  Improvements to the abnormally dry conditions in eastern North Carolina were made in response to this week’s rain.  This rain event was needed in the region as the last several months had been dry with near-record dryness for many locations.  Even with the rain, the indicators supported the introduction of moderate drought in western North Carolina, western South Carolina, and eastern Tennessee, and an expansion of moderate drought in northern Georgia and into Alabama. The dryness was quite evident over the last 60-90 days and many of the rivers and streams are running below normal as well.  Impacts are minimal at this time, but further precipitation will be needed to counteract this trend of drought development.  Additional expansions of abnormally dry conditions were made in both Alabama and Georgia as well as a new area of moderate drought in central Tennessee.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast/Mid-Atlantic">
   <p>Most of the region recorded normal to slightly above normal precipitation this week, holding off most expansion of dryness and drought in the region.  A small pocket of abnormally dry conditions was expanded into southeast Pennsylvania and across the border into New Jersey.  Even with slightly above normal precipitation, the area of eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey is showing a strong dry signal over the last several months.  With the rains, no additional degradations were made this week.  The Mid-Atlantic recorded 2-3 inches of rain above normal this week, which helped to reverse the dry pattern over much of the region that had developed over the last several months.  Improvements to abnormally dry and moderate drought conditions were made in West Virginia and Virginia.  Improvements were not more widespread as many areas still have precipitation deficits over the last several months, but the recent rains prevented any worsening of conditions and allowed for improvements to begin.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="West">
   <p>As the storm that impacted much of the eastern half of the United States formed in the Four Corners region, it brought widespread precipitation over much of eastern Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming.  Abnormally dry conditions were improved over eastern Nevada and Utah this week.  A reanalysis of the data available in northwest Utah allowed for an improvement to the conditions there by a full category as well.  Abnormally dry conditions were improved upon in southern Wyoming as well as northeastern New Mexico.  Dryness returned to portions of the Pacific Northwest over the last several weeks, and this allowed for abnormally dry conditions to be introduced over central and northeast Oregon.  In California, some moderate drought was removed in the northern portion of the state</p>
