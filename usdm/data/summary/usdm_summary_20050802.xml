  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 10-day period that may affect areas experiencing dryness or drought across the country include: 1) a cold front will provide temporary relief from hot temperatures, along with some scattered precipitation for the central U.S. and Great Lakes August 3-5; 2) a large ridge is expected to build over the Great Lakes August 9-13, causing above-normal temperatures to spread across the central Plains, Corn Belt, Great Lakes, and Northeast; 3) monsoonal flow will provide an increased opportunity for above-normal precipitation for the Southwest and southern Rockies August 9-13, bringing potential short-term relief to these regions; and 4) moderate to strong trade winds are expected for Hawaii August 4-11 that should bring enhanced rainfall to the windward sides of the islands, but less rainfall amounts on the leeward sides.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Showers during the week brought some relief from the abnormal dryness (D0) to the Island of Hawaii. However, dryness continued on parts of the other islands.</p>

  <region name="The Central United States">
   <p>For the week, a band of heavier precipitation fell across southern Iowa, northern Illinois and Indiana, and southeastern Michigan. An area of heavier precipitation also fell across south-central Illinois. As a result, drought conditions improved slightly in southern and eastern Illinois, northern Indiana, and southern Michigan. Some improvement in the moderate drought (D1) conditions also occurred with rainfall in west-central Wisconsin. Meanwhile, abnormal dryness has developed across parts of northern Minnesota, and moderate drought expanded across northwest Wisconsin and the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Duluth, MN, only recorded 0.82 inches of precipitation for July (20% of normal). In northern Michigan, both Sault Ste. Marie and Traverse City experienced their seventh straight month with below-normal precipitation in July. Conditions also deteriorated slightly during the week in eastern Iowa. For the Quad Cities area of Iowa and Illinois, the January through July period ranked as the third driest since 1872 (9.54 inches in 1928, 10.49 inches in 1936, and 10.81 inches in 2005). The normal precipitation total for this period is 22.74 inches.</p>
   <p>In Missouri, very little precipitation fell in the severe and extreme drought areas in the central and northeastern parts of the state. Columbia, MO, had six consecutive days above 100F earlier in July, and finished the month with 0.62 inches of precipitation (16% of normal). There was some precipitation for the week in northwestern Missouri, and abnormally dry conditions were removed from the extreme northwest corner and adjacent southwestern Iowa. Reassessment of the July precipitation totals also allowed for some improvement in the D2 and D1 drought areas in the southeastern part of Missouri.</p>
   <p>Rainfall during July across Arkansas reflected almost a completely reversed pattern compared to the rainfall during June. As a result of recent rainfall, there has been improvement in the drought conditions across the southern part of the state. Meanwhile, drought conditions have deteriorated across the west-central, northwest, and north-central regions. In Oklahoma, moderate drought conditions expanded across the northeast part of the state, but rainfall brought improvements to drought conditions in the south.</p>
   <p>Although July was generally a wet month for eastern Texas, extreme drought conditions (D3) still exist in the northeast corner of the state. Rainfall during the week brought some improvement to the dry conditions in the western part of the state, and improved drought conditions along the Rio Grande Valley. Assessment of the rains from Hurricane Emily allowed for some additional improvement to the severe drought (D2) in far south Texas.</p>
   <p>In Nebraska, hot and dry conditions in the central and southwest part of the state have initiated the reintroduction of severe drought (D2) into this area. In North Platte, 11 of the past 14 days have been 95F or higher, with only 1.82 inches of precipitation since June 15 (40% of normal). During that same two-week period, McCook has been over 100F on 9 days. Hot and dry conditions have also led to an expansion of moderate drought (D1) in east-central Nebraska. Meanwhile, a series of thunderstorms in recent weeks across the north-central part of the state has helped improve dry conditions there. Recent dryness has also expanded D0 across parts of southeastern South Dakota.</p>

  <region name="The Eastern United States">
   <p>In the Northeast, the continuation of a dry spell that began during May has led to the development of abnormally dry (D0) conditions across Rhode Island, Connecticut, Long Island, and southern New York. In upstate New York, D0 conditions also expanded across counties south of Lake Ontario. Recent rainfall, however, improved D0 conditions in the counties adjacent to Lake Erie in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Rainfall totals for the week exceeded two inches across parts of northern Ohio. Heavier rainfall during the week also improved the D0 conditions in northeastern North Carolina.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Western United States">
   <p>Much of the western United States was hot and dry during July. In Denver, July was the second warmest and third driest July on record going back to 1872. Only 0.27 inches of precipitation was recorded (13% of normal). Fort Collins, CO, also had their second warmest July on record, along with their 8 th driest (0.32 inches of precipitation). In Montana, Helena had its driest July on record with only 0.07 inches of precipitation for the month. As a result of the warmth and dryness across Montana, an area of severe drought (D2) has developed along the Front Range, while D1 and D0 conditions expanded across northern Montana. July was a very dry month across New Mexico as well, allowing moderate drought (D1) to develop across southwest New Mexico, and abnormal dryness (D0) to spread across all of central and eastern New Mexico. Parts of Arizona finally received some beneficial rainfall during the week, allowing for slight improvements in the dryness and drought conditions in the central and southern parts of the state. According to NASS, 61% of the pastures and rangeland in Arizona are rated as being in poor and very poor condition.</p>
