  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>A series of frontal systems will affect the eastern half of the U.S. during the period May 31-June 4, bringing occasional bouts of showers and thunderstorms. Precipitation totals during this period will generally be an inch or less. The exception will be in the Northeast, where more concentrated areas of rainfall may help alleviate dryness. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will also continue across parts of Florida providing limited relief. Much of the country from the Rockies westward is expected to remain dry during the period, although a few disturbances arriving from the Pacific will bring mainly light precipitation to the Northwest states along with unseasonably cool temperatures.</p>
   <p>The highest precipitation probabilities during the period June 5-June 9 will occur along the northern tier of states from the Pacific Northwest into the Northeast. Below normal to normal precipitation coupled with above normal temperatures is forecast from the Southern Plains through the Southeast.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Rainfall across the Hawaiian Islands was scattered with minimal accumulations throughout the period. No changes were made to the drought areas this week even though precipitation deficits continue to build.</p>

  <region name="The Mid-Atlantic States and The Gulf Coast">
   <p>A second week of significant precipitation occurred throughout much of Central and Eastern West Virginia and most of Western and Northern Virginia. Two to 4 inches of rain fell in this region (in addition to the 3 to 5 inches received last week). Even though most meteorological drought has retreated for now, hydrological drought is still a concern along the fringes of the region. D0(W) was applied to the regions which experienced significant rainfall over the past 2 weeks yet still have lingering hydrological impacts. Streamflows are currently running well above normal and many of the reservoir levels are at or above target levels for this time of year. Charleston, West Virginia is experiencing their wettest May on record with 8.76 inches of precipitation (almost 50% of the year to date total) received through May 28th. Normal May rainfall for Charleston is about 4 inches. As a result of the continuing rains throughout much of West Virginia, North Central Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, D0 was removed. D3, D2 and D1 were reduced in Western North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky and hydrological drought was added. Coastal portions of the Carolinas continue to miss the bulk of the precipitation and remain in D0 and D1.</p>
   <p>D1 was added to the Florida Panhandle extending westward along the coast to Louisiana as conditions continue to deteriorate. Several counties in this region have not received rain in weeks. Farmers, which have been able to get their equipment to penetrate the dry earth, are planting seed in dust. Streams are also running dry and cattle are drinking from pumps which the farmers have provided. As a result of significant rainfall this week (4 to 8 inch accumulations), a hydrological impact line, D1(W) to D4(W), has been added to Southern Florida from Lake Okeechobee southward. The rains received this past week have abated the short-term agriculture and fire danger impacts for the time being, although hydrological drought still remains critical.</p>

  <region name="The Northeastern States">
   <p>A semi-stationary upper-level low pressure system over the Great Lakes brought unsettled weather to much of the eastern half of the U.S. last week. Widespread precipitation occurred from the Southern Appalachians up through Maryland and Delaware, along the coast into Massachusetts. Much of the precipitation was associated with a cold front which triggered thunderstorms and dumped upwards of 2 to 4 inches across much of this region. As a result, drought conditions improved by one category (D1 to D0(W)) from Central Maryland and up the coast to Massachusetts. In fact, precipitation received was enough to warrant applying a hydrology impact line in this region, as agriculture and fire danger impacts have been minimized for the near term. Portions of Northern New England did not receive significant amounts of precipitation with this series of events and has remained dry over the last couple of months. Much of the state of Maine has only received 50% to 75% of the mean precipitation for the year so far. Several indicators including the Palmer Drought Index and soil moisture anomaly maps indicate that conditions in Maine have deteriorated. D1 was therefore introduced this week to most of coastal Maine and part of the mountains in the northern part of the state.</p>
   <p>The week was mostly dry over the Northeast states, with generally less than an inch of rain estimated from radar reports falling in the 24 hours ending Tuesday morning. D1 expanded to cover most of Pennsylvania, much of New York, and most of southern New England, reflecting very low streamflows and low drought indices, soil moisture levels, and long-term precipitation percentiles.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Warm and dry conditions persisted throughout the West. Maximum temperature departures for the week were upwards of 15F in Nevada, Oregon, Idaho and Western Montana. Wildfires have been on the increase in parts of Northern California, New Mexico and Nevada. A wildfire in Northern Nevada has burned more than 6,000 acres and was only 40% contained by May 28th. Strong winds have fueled already dry conditions in this region making it difficult to keep even minor fires under control. One lightning-sparked fire north of Reno, Nevada was declared contained last Saturday, but was fanned back to life the next day by 40 mph winds forcing the evacuation of an RV park. The Vegetation Health Index (VHI), the Palmer Drought Index and soil moisture indicators all show a deterioration of conditions throughout many of the western states including Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada, Montana, Oregon and California. As a result of the worsening conditions, D2 was expanded along the Oregon coast as well as the Northern California/Nevada border. Hydrological boundaries were also removed in California, Nevada, Wyoming and parts of Idaho and Montana to reflect the growing agriculture and fire impact in these regions.</p>
