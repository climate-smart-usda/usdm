  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 5 days (November 26-30), the Southwest's most significant storm of the autumn will produce as much as 1 to 2 inches of rain from southern California into the Four Corners States.  However, heavy rain in a short time period could cause flash flooding and mud slides, especially in areas burned by recent wildfires.  Toward week's end, locally heavy rain will develop from the central Gulf Coast States into the southern Atlantic region, while snow showers will linger downwind of the Great Lakes.  Meanwhile, snow could briefly affect the Rockies and adjacent High Plains on November 29-30.  Elsewhere, mostly dry weather will prevail through month's end across the Northwest and the middle and upper Mississippi Valley.</p>
   <p>The CPC 6- to 10-day forecast (December 1-5) calls for cold weather and near- to below-normal precipitation across the majority of the U.S.  Near- to above-normal temperatures will be limited to the West, while dry conditions will be especially likely across the Mississippi Valley, the southeastern Plains, and areas west of the Rockies.  Wetter-than-normal conditions will be confined to the northern High Plains; the lower Southeast, including northern Florida; and areas from the lower Great Lakes region into northern New England.</p>

  <region name="Alaska and Hawaii">
   <p>No changes were made in Alaska, where cold, mostly dry weather prevailed.  In contrast, heavy rain continued across Hawaii's western islands.  Kauai's Mt. Waialeale received 13.75 inches during the final 48 hours of the previous drought monitoring period on November 16-18, then collected another 2.41 inches on November 21-22.  During the latter event, the 24-hour total reached 4.25 inches in Kokee, Kauai, while a small landslide was reported on northern Kauai near Hanalei.  Lihue, Kauai, received 5.07 inches of rain during the first 10.5 months of 2008, followed by 5.42 inches from November 16-23.  Meanwhile on Oahu, Honolulu received nearly 40% (2.76 of 7.02 inches) of its year-to-date rainfall from November 14-23.  Extreme drought (D3) was erased from Oahu, replaced by severe drought (D2).</p>

  <region name="The East and South">
   <p>A period of remarkably quiet weather came to an end with a round of showers on November 24.  Some rain and snow lingered across the Northeast into November 25.  In drought-affected areas of the East and South, rainfall totals were generally an inch or less.  Specific totals for the last 24 hours of the monitoring period (ending 7 am EST on November 25) included 0.94 inch in Crossville, Tennessee; 0.73 inch in Charleston, West Virginia; and 0.61 inch in Jackson, Kentucky.  Totals were generally less than one-quarter inch in drought-affected areas lying east of the southern Appalachians.  While the rain provided a boost in topsoil moisture, totals were insufficient to improve the long-term drought picture.  In fact, there was a small expansion of the core extreme to exceptional drought (D3 to D4) area centered on the southern Appalachians.  In Florida, continued dry weather led to the introduction of moderate drought (D1) in Tampa and surrounding areas.  This part of Florida was bypassed by Tropical Storm Fay in August.  Some other parts of northern and central Florida have been very dry since Fay's passage, and those areas are now depicted as abnormally dry (D0).  Meanwhile, abnormal dryness and moderate drought conditions (D0 and D1) were expanded to the west and northwest in Tennessee and Kentucky due to various factors, including low stream flows and soil moisture shortages.  Elsewhere, separate areas of abnormal dryness (D0) in southwestern Alabama and southeastern Louisiana were bridged due to mounting short-term rainfall deficits.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Great Lakes Region">
   <p>Precipitation was mostly confined to the snow-belt areas downwind of the Great Lakes.  Squalls were sufficiently heavy enough to bring about a slight reduction in the coverage of abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1) across Michigan's Upper Peninsula.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Despite a week of dry weather and wildly fluctuating temperatures, there were few changes in the Plains' drought depiction.  Some worsening of drought occurred, however, in south-central Texas, where both San Antonio and Austin (Camp Mabry) are within a few days of completing their respective fourth-driest January-November periods on record.  In both San Antonio and Austin, drier January-November periods were observed only in the historic drought years of 1917, 1954, and 1956.  Elsewhere on the Plains, conditions remained mostly favorable for winter wheat development, despite a recent turn toward drier conditions.  In Texas, the percentage of winter wheat rated in very poor to poor condition by the U.S. Department of Agriculture has crept higher in recent weeks, from 11 to 16% between October 26 and November 23.  During the same 4-week period, the percentage of wheat rated very poor to poor in Kansas remains low, but has climbed from 3 to 8%.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>With the entire region remaining under warm, mostly dry conditions, no changes to the drought depiction were introduced.  However, such a pattern of dry weather and unusual warmth, if it were to persist, would eventually lead to further increases in the severity and areal extent of Western drought.  Agriculturally, a lack of moisture remained a concern with respect to proper establishment of Northwestern winter wheat.  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 33% of Washington's wheat crop was rated in very poor to poor condition on November 23, along with 24% of Oregon's crop.</p>
