  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>From November 26-30, the Northwest will remain the primary focus for significant precipitation across the western half of the U.S. Northwestern rain and snow will initially wane by Thanksgiving Day, November 27, but will return to western Washington shortly thereafter. Precipitation will expand across the Northwest on November 29-30, reaching areas as far south as central California by month's end. Beneficial precipitation will also overspread key winter wheat and watershed areas across the Interior Northwest toward the end of November. Farther east, a developing storm system is forecast to produce widespread precipitation along and east of a line from the western Gulf Coast region to the lower Great Lakes States. Once again, significant precipitation will largely bypass drought areas of the Plains and Mississippi Valley, although snow showers are possible later in the week across the upper Great Lakes region. The NWS 6- to 10-day outlook for December 1-5 calls for the likelihood of cool, stormy weather across northern and central California and the Northwest. However, little, if any, precipitation is expected across the Plains, Southwest, and upper Midwest. Some showers are possible, however, in the eastern-fringe drought areas from northeastern Texas to near Lake Michigan.</p>

  <region name="Alaska and Hawaii">
   <p>There were no changes to the depiction of abnormal dryness (D0) in southeastern mainland Alaska, where cold, mostly dry weather prevailed. Farther south, seasonal showers continued in windward locations across the central and western Hawaiian islands, while mostly dry weather returned to the Big Island. Despite diminished shower activity on the Big Island, Hilo's month-to-date (November 1-24) rainfall remained above normal (14.48 inches, or 115 percent of normal). However, moderate to severe drought (D1 to D2) persisted in leeward areas from Oahu to western portions of the Big Island.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes Region">
   <p>Early in the period (November 18), precipitation lingered across the Mississippi Valley. Locally heavy showers returned to the lower Mississippi Valley on November 23, further reducing the coverage of abnormal dryness (D0) in southeastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi. Farther north and west, widespread, generally light snow blanketed the north-central United States from November 21-23. Despite some heavier snow (6 inches or more) across the Black Hills of South Dakota and in a band from eastern South Dakota to near Lake Superior, there were negligible reductions in moderate drought (D1). A band of heavy rain developed farther east on November 23-24, dropping more than 2 inches from east-central Iowa to northeastern Wisconsin. Resulting reductions in abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1) served to tighten the gradient between the area of improvement and the core area of extreme drought (D3) centered in the upper Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, there was little overall change in the Plains' drought depiction, which continued to feature a broad swath of moderate to extreme drought (D1 to D3) stretching from Montana to northern Texas. High winds accompanied the latest surge of cold air across the Plains, where Great Falls, Montana (72 m.p.h. on November 19), clocked its highest November gust since 1978.</p>
   <p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 19 percent of the nation's winter wheat was rated in very poor to poor condition on November 23, significantly higher than 8 percent at this time last year. On the Plains, at least one-fifth of the wheat crop was rated very poor to poor in five of seven major producing states. They were: South Dakota (33 percent very poor to poor), Colorado (28 percent), Montana (25 percent), Texas (25 percent), and Kansas (22 percent).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and Far West">
   <p>Following the previous week's widespread Western precipitation, rain and snow showers were largely confined to the northern Rockies and the Northwest. As a result, there were inconsequential changes to the drought portrayal across the majority of the West. The primary concern across the Great Basin, Southwest, and Interior Northwest remains long-term, hydrological issues, including low reservoir levels. In contrast, very wet conditions persisted from the Washington Cascades westward, while there were some slight reductions of abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1) across eastern Washington. Following some blowing dust and a wind gust to 63 m.p.h. (its highest since December 12, 1995) on November 19, Spokane, Washington, received 8.5 inches of snow on November 20-21 and another 2.4 inches on November 23-24. Despite the precipitation, a portion of the Northwestern winter wheat crop continued to suffer from a lack of soil moisture. As of November 23, USDA rated Oregon's wheat 41 percent very poor to poor, while 20 percent of Washington's crop was reported in very poor to poor condition. Farther east, the northernmost Rockies again netted enough snow to warrant some further improvement from extreme to severe drought (D3 to D2) across northwestern Montana.</p>
