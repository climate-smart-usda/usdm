  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 10-day period that may affect areas experiencing dryness or drought include: 1) Additional precipitation is expected in the Sierra Nevada as another storm follows this years preferred storm track southeastward across or near the California coast; 2) Farther north, only light precipitation is forecast across the Northwest; 3) Mostly dry weather is forecast on the northern Plains; 4) Two more storms are forecast to emerge from the southwestern United States by mid-March. The first will cross the nations southern tier later this week, bringing the likelihood of precipitation to the southern High Plains and a chance of showers in the Southeast; 5) The NWS 6-10 day outlook for March 13-17 calls for wet weather in the Southeast, except southern Florida; a continuation of unfavorably dry conditions in the Northwest; and the return of mostly dry weather in California.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Generally dry weather prevailed in Hawaii, following recent drought-easing rainfall. In addition, temperatures climbed well above normal in many areas, peaking at daily-record levels (85F on February 27) in Honolulu, Oahu. Hardest hit by the ongoing drought remains western Molokai, where extreme drought (D3) conditions exist for agricultural concerns and the threat of wildfires. Meanwhile, widespread showers dotted Puerto Rico, although little change was noted in the abnormally dry (D0) area along the southwestern coast. In addition, the area was expanded to encompass some southern and eastern portions of the island, in part due to low streamflows.</p>

  <region name="The Central Appalachians">
   <p>In early March, a sprawling East Coast storm brought generally light precipitation to an area of hydrological dryness (D0) in southern West Virginia and surrounding locations. Farther north, locally an inch or more of liquid equivalent fell in western sections of Pennsylvania and New York, resulting in a slight improvement of abnormally dry (D0) conditions.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Severe drought (D2) persisted in parts of Montana, where cold, mostly dry weather prevailed. Farther south, hydrological dryness (D0) concerns lingered in western and southern Nebraska, while a pocket of moderate drought (D1) continued to affect west-central Iowa. However, as much as 0.7 inch of moisture brought additional relief to the formerly dry (D0) area in northeastern Kansas. In western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, a wintry mix of precipitation, totaling 0.7 inch or less, dampened topsoils but brought little relief from large long-term moisture deficits. Only light showers (mostly 0.5 inch or less) fell in extreme southern Texas, following extremely dry conditions last year, necessitating an upgrade to moderate drought (D1) conditions.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Torrential rain (4 inches or more) fell from southeastern Louisiana to west-central Georgia, resulting in a general reduction of abnormally dry (D0) and moderate drought (D1) conditions. Locally as much as a foot of rain drenched southern portions of Mississippi and Alabama. Only 1 to 2 inches of precipitation fell, however, in the southern Appalachians and adjacent piedmont areas, leaving an area of extreme drought (D3) intact, primarily in western North Carolina. On March 4, showers and thunderstorms swept across Floridas peninsula, temporarily easing citrus irrigation requirements. Despite the rain, which locally totaled 2 inches or more in west-central and north-central sections of the peninsula, an area of exceptional drought (D4) persisted. Between January 1 and March 5, more than 1,500 Florida wildfires burned nearly 108,000 acres. As of March 5, the Florida Division of Forestrys county-level Keetch-Byram Drought Index--a wildfire danger indicator--remained above 600 (on a scale of 0 to 800, with 800 being maximum dryness) in 20 central and southern Florida counties.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>An average of 3 inches of precipitation fell in the Sierra Nevada, boosting the water content of the high-elevation snow pack to 21 inches (85 percent of the early-March normal) by March 6, according to the California Department of Water Resources. Nevertheless, summer water-supply concerns persist in California and other areas fed by the Sierra Nevada spring runoff. More serious precipitation deficits exist in key watershed areas in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies, where moderate hydrological drought (D1) continues. A small area of severe drought (D2) was added in the northern Cascades of Washington, where water-year precipitation (since October 1, 2000) is running barely 50 percent of normal, according to USDAs SNOTEL network. In the Skagit River Basin, low water levels in the Baker and Shannon Reservoirs caused power generation to be halted to allow for reservoir recharge.</p>
