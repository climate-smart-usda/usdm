  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 5 days (February 18-22), temperatures are going to remain cool over much of the United States.  Temperatures will range from 12 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit below normal over the central Plains to 3-6 degrees below normal over the southern tier of the country.  Temperatures are expected to be 3-6 degrees above normal over the Pacific Northwest and upper portions of New England.  Precipitation looks to be widespread during this time, with precipitation maxima over Arkansas, Colorado and the California coast.  The Climate Prediction Center 6-10 day forecast (February 23-27) shows much of the eastern two-thirds of the United States having the best chance for below-normal temperatures, with the coolest readings expected over the Mid Atlantic states.  Most of Alaska and into the Pacific Northwest show a very good likelihood of above-normal temperatures during this time.  Dry conditions over the Great Lakes and New England regions should be expected while the best chances for above-normal precipitation will be over much of the southern United States, with the best chances over east Texas, Louisiana and Florida.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>No changes were made this week in Alaska or Puerto Rico.  In Hawaii, the current drought intensified on the islands of Lanai and Molokai.  On Lanai, D2 was expanded to include the entire island; on Molokai, D1 expanded over the rest of the island.  Both islands are seeing significant deterioration of pastures with the drought, causing agricultural impacts.  Hydrological issues on the Big Island continue, forcing more of the southeast flank of the island to go from A to AH for impact designation.  Some residents on water catchments have to haul water, which is causing a significant economic impact on the Puna district on the east side of the island.</p>

  <region name="Texas">
   <p>Precipitation, including significant snowfall, was common over much of Texas this week.  Winter weather in the Dallas metro brought upwards of a foot of wet snow, and areas farther south recorded more rain, continuing the wet pattern across the state.  At the DFW airport in Dallas/Ft.Worth, 12.5 inches of snow was recorded over a 24-hour period (February 11-12).  This is the greatest 24-hour snowfall total on record at DFW since record keeping began in the area back in 1899.  D1 was eliminated in south Texas, leaving just a few counties in abnormally dry conditions based on long-term deficits.  This is the first time Texas is drought free since November 2007.</p>

  <region name="The West">
   <p>A mix of improvements and degradations this week for the western United States.  With continuing rain, most of the D0 was eliminated from southern California this week.  The recent wet pattern has eliminated precipitation deficits and allowed for the improvements.  In northern California, D2 was expanded as both upper and lower elevations are well behind normal for the current water year coupled with several dry years recently.  D0 was expanded along the Cascades in Washington and Oregon as below-normal snowpack and hydrological issues are becoming more apparent in the region.  Dryness in the upper and lower elevations over the last several months has warranted the expansion of D0 and D1 conditions in the state.  D0 was expanded to include almost all of Wyoming outside the extreme eastern portions of the state and D1 was expanded in the northwest part of the state.  In Montana, D0 and D1 were expanded in response to the low snowpack being recorded this water year.  D1 was expanded in the western portions of the state, while a new area of D0 was introduced in the north central.  D1 was also introduced into the south central part of the state, being expanded out of Wyoming.</p>
