  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 5 days (May 10-14) temperatures look to be above normal for almost the entire United States.  Average temperatures are expected to be 3-5F above normal for the eastern half of the country and in the west, 5-15F above normal.  Precipitation should be focused along the southern Plains, with Oklahoma and Texas showing maximum amounts.  The northern High Plains, northern Rocky Mountains, and upper Midwest also should receive decent rains as well.  The first named tropical storm of the year, Andrea, is likely to impact the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and maybe Florida and North Carolina.  Rains from this system could impact the current drought depiction in a very positive manner.</p>
   <p>The 6-10 day outlook (May 15-19) focuses on a ridge centered over the western United States and a trough over the North Atlantic influencing the weather on the East Coast.  Temperatures look to be warmer than normal over the West and High Plains and also into the Southeast.  Cooler- than- normal temperatures should be expected over New England and southern Texas.  Temperatures in Alaska look to be cooler in the northern extents of the state and warmer in the south.  Precipitation in Alaska is forecasted to be above normal in the south and below normal in the northwest portions of the state.  Precipitation should be above normal for the central Plains and into the Ohio River Valley to the East Coast.  Below- normal precipitation in the Pacific Northwest should be expected as well.</p>

  <region name="The Delta and Southeast">
   <p>Rains over the southeast did not improve the drought status for any portion of the region.  In fact, the rains were below average for this time of year and allowed for further expansion of the drought depiction.  In the Carolinas, D0 was expanded to include most of North Carolina and the remaining drought-free areas of South Carolina.  Agricultural concerns over dry soils and fire danger were the impacts prompting the expansion of D0.  In Alabama, the remaining drought-free area was filled in with D0, while the D2 conditions were pushed to the south.  D3 conditions also expanded to the south and west to include portions of eastern Mississippi as well.  Florida saw some rain in the southern part of the state, but with more water restrictions in the area, a continued high fire danger, and Lake Okeechobee continuing to drop, no improvements were made this week.  The D0 area around Tampa was changed to D1, as the dryness continues to spread through the state.</p>

  <region name="The Plains and Upper Midwest">
   <p>Flooding rains in South Dakota, Nebraska and parts of Iowa were all part of a strong storm system that affected the High Plains last week, bringing with it relief to many locations affected by long-term drought conditions.  Four-day rain totals were impressive for the region, with Omaha, Nebraska, recording 7.46 inches; Falls City, Nebraska, recording 7.15 inches; Logan, Iowa, recording 7.98 inches; and Shenandoah, Iowa, recording 7.52 inches.  In South Dakota, the following totals were recorded: Epiphany, 10.00 inches, Canova, 9.00 inches, and Aberdeen, 9.00 inches.  With widespread rain, improvements were made to the drought status in many locations.  In Nebraska, eastern Wyoming and South Dakota the lingering D3 was removed, and D2 was reduced in the west central part of South Dakota.  D0 and D1 conditions continued to be shifted to the west in both South Dakota and Nebraska.  In Wyoming, D0 was removed in the northeast and D1 conditions were pushed farther to the east.  D1 conditions were improved in the eastern sections of the state as well.</p>
   <p>Strong thunderstorms in Oklahoma and Texas toward the end of the current Drought Monitor period allowed for the improvement of the D0 and D1 conditions in south Texas, and the D0 was eliminated in Oklahoma.  The current wet pattern has allowed a full recovery in the state of Oklahoma where soils are saturated and lakes and reservoirs are filling up.</p>
   <p>The drought depiction for northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan also was downgraded this week.  Much of the recent rains have not developed in this region, and the area is showing signs of impacts, mainly related to low lake levels, dry soils, and fire dangers.  Several forest fires have been reported in Minnesota, and fishing tournaments in the state have been cancelled because of low lake levels.</p>

  <region name="The West">
   <p>Rain was quite common and widespread through much of the West this last week.  Almost all regions saw some rain except for southern California, Arizona and southern Nevada.  The only change in drought status this week was in Montana, where much of the D0 and D1 in eastern Montana were improved.  Reports of impacts related to the drought in California continued to come in as cattlemen were contemplating selling off portions of their herds because of lack of available forage and beekeepers were reporting significant losses in both bees and honey production.  The lack of rain has not allowed for the usual green-up of pastures and rangelands utilized by cattlemen, forcing them to make tough business decisions.  The lack of flowering plants has hurt bees searching for available food sources.  Along with a continued heightened fire danger in California, reports of wildlife moving into residential areas looking for food and water have surfaced as well.</p>
