  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 10-day period that may affect some of the areas experiencing dryness or drought across the country include: 1) the disturbance that brought very heavy rains to southern Florida October 1-4 is expected to move off of the East Coast without providing much relief to drought areas in the Southeast; 2) Tropical Storm Keith is predicted to make landfall in northeastern Mexico October 5 and may bring heavy rains to the Rio Grande Valley region; 3) remaining moisture from both Keith and Tropical Storm Olivia off of western Mexico may push northward and interact with the mid-latitude westerlies; and 4) the latest 6-10 day forecast from the Climate Prediction Center (valid October 10-14) shows a large swath of above-normal precipitation for the period from the southwestern U.S. to the Northeast, which may provide relief for some of the areas experiencing drought.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Rainfall during the September 26-30 period across Hawaii helped improve the long-term dryness affecting the state. Severe drought (D2), with agricultural and wildfire-related impacts, still exists on parts of Hawaii and Maui. Improvements to first stage drought (D1: A,F) were seen on Hawaii, eastern Maui, and Molokai. Leeward sides of Oahu and Kauai were upgraded to D0 (abnormally dry). Long-term deficits remain across the state. Meanwhile, generous rains September 26-30 in northwestern Puerto Rico helped remove the D0 (abnormally dry) classification from this region, although D0 still exists on the northeast coast of the island.</p>

  <region name="New England">
   <p>Dryness throughout the summer across eastern Maine has led to reduced streamflows and soil moisture levels. Caribou, Maine, ended September with a monthly precipitation deficit of approximately two inches. As a result of this dryness, the D0 (abnormally dry) classification has been placed over the eastern half of the state.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Midwest">
   <p>Another dry week occurred across parts of the Plains states. Drought conditions deteriorated in Kansas and Oklahoma. First stage drought (D1) expanded into southwestern Kansas and southeastern Colorado. Severe drought (D2) expanded northward across almost all of Oklahoma and across most of eastern Kansas. An area of extreme drought (D3) conditions now exists in south-central Nebraska and north-central Kansas. In all of these regions, the concerns include the winter wheat crop (which is now either being planted or emerging), low soil moisture levels, low stock ponds, low streamflows, and a very high fire danger. First stage drought (D1) also expanded across southwestern Missouri.</p>
   <p>In Oklahoma, the combined August-September two-month period was the driest on record for the state. The statewide precipitation total for the period was only 17% of normal. Two communities, Hollis and Mangum in southwestern Oklahoma, have gone 79 days without measurable precipitation as of September 30. In Texas, meanwhile, Amarillo, Lubbock, and Midland had their driest September on record.</p>
   <p>September continued a dry trend across central and northeastern Minnesota that has lasted throughout the growing season. Since April 1, precipitation has been approximately 70% of normal in an area from Montevideo in the west-central part of the state, northeastward to Grand Marais on Lake Superior. The abnormally dry (D0) category has expanded to include this entire region. In the central part of the state north of the Twin Cities, from Cambridge to St. Cloud to Montevideo, the April through September dryness ranks in the lowest 10th percentile for the historical record. First-stage drought (D1) conditions now include this area.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South and Southeast">
   <p>After a couple of weeks of very beneficial tropical moisture, this past week (September 26-October 3) was dry across most of the region except for southern Florida. Generous precipitation over the week did help push D0 (abnormally dry) conditions to north of Lake Okeechobee. The core area of exceptional (D4) drought continues to be located in much of central Alabama and east-central Mississippi. Water restrictions have been implemented for Birmingham and several surrounding communities. One of the main sources for water supply, Lake Purdy, just east of the city, is at a level that can supply water at a normal rate for approximately 52 more days. Other sources for water are available and will be utilized by these communities.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Generally dry conditions occurred across the West during the past week. The exception to this was in the Northwest. Precipitation in this region did remove some of the D0 (abnormally dry) conditions in northern Idaho and northwestern Montana. In Arizona, the D1 (first stage drought) designation for agricultural and wildfire impacts was expanded southward based on long-term precipitation departures to include the central part of the state. The water year (October 1999-September 2000) ended in Tucson with 6.09 inches of precipitation, which is the fifth-lowest total on record and only 51% of normal. The first stage drought (D1) designation was also expanded across northwestern New Mexico. Southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico were included into the D0 (abnormally dry) designation as a result of below-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures during July, August, and September.</p>
