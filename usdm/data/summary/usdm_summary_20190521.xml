  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <intro>
   <p>A series of Pacific upper-level weather systems, and their associated surface lows and fronts, moved across the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) during this U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) week.  These systems dropped half an inch or more of precipitation across much of the West, Plains, and Midwest, as well as parts of the Northeast.  Heavy rains of 2 to 4 inches, or more, fell across parts of California, especially the upslope regions.  The systems triggered severe weather in the Plains, with training thunderstorms dropping flooding rains.  Two inches or more of precipitation was measured from northern Texas to Illinois, parts of the northern Plains, eastern Texas to Louisiana, and Upper Mississippi Valley to western Great Lakes.  Parts of Oklahoma to southeast Kansas saw more than 5 inches of rain.  Precipitation was sparse in southern Arizona and New Mexico, and across most of the Southeast where high pressure dominated, with less than a tenth of an inch observed.  Most of the precipitation fell on areas that were drought-free.  Drought and abnormal dryness contracted in parts of the Southwest, but expanded in areas that received below-normal precipitation this week, had continued and prolonged precipitation deficits, or were experiencing drought impacts.  These included parts of southern Texas, the Pacific Northwest, the northern Plains, the Southeast, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the southern parts of the Alaskan panhandle. With the elimination of D2 from New Mexico, this week is the first time in the history of the USDM that the CONUS has been free of Severe to Exceptional Drought.  However, it also marks the first time that Extreme Drought (D3) has been analyzed for Alaska.</p>

  <forecast>
   <p>Next week (May 23-28) will largely see a repeat of this week’s weather pattern.  A couple upper-level Pacific weather systems will move across the West, then roar out of the Southwest, across the Plains, to the Great Lakes, dropping several inches of rain across parts of the southern to central Plains and Midwest.  Half an inch to locally 2 inches of precipitation are expected across much of the West, except little to no precipitation is forecast for southern portions of the Southwest and parts of the Pacific Northwest.  The weather systems will keep western temperatures cooler than normal, while the North Atlantic High will keep temperatures warmer than normal across the southeastern third of the CONUS.  Little to no precipitation is predicted for much of the southern Plains to Southeast, although the western Carolinas might see up to an inch.  Over an inch of precipitation is expected for northern portions of the Northeast, while southern portions should receive half an inch or less.  For May 29-June 5, more of the same.  Odds favor cooler-than-normal temperatures from the Southwest to Great Lakes and southern coastal Alaska, while warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected for the Southern Plains to Mid-Atlantic region, the West Coast to northern Rockies, and much of Alaska.  Odds favor below-normal precipitation for the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast coastal states, Washington and Oregon in the Pacific Northwest, parts of New Mexico, the North Dakota and Minnesota D0 areas, and southern Alaska panhandle.  Odds favor wetter-than-normal conditions for the rest of Alaska, the rest of the West, and most of the Great Plains to Northeast.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>In Alaska, much of the panhandle was drier than normal this week with the rest of the state having a mixed precipitation anomaly pattern.  Long-term precipitation deficits remained in the panhandle, with drought impacts being reported.  Salal damage was reported near Ketchikan and Prince of Wales; hemlock sawfly damage was widespread in 2018, amounting to the third largest area of damage in 46 years of data, and continues in 2019.  D1-D2 were expanded, and D3 was introduced, in the southern portions of the panhandle.</p>
   <p>In Hawaii, most of the stations were drier than normal this week, and record high temperatures were set on May 19 across the state -- at Lihue, Kahului, Hilo, and Honolulu.  After getting decent amounts of rain in April, the windward side of the Big Island has dried out quickly. The FSA has been getting quite a few reports of pastures deteriorating. There was even a report of a bonsai grower near Pahoa indicating that he's had to start watering his plants. Usually he doesn't have to do any watering. These reports are consistent with rainfall and satellite vegetation (NDVI) data.  Consequently, D1 was expanded on the Big Island; D0 expanded into most of the windward slopes of the Big Island; D0 over the Kona slopes was pushed westward; D0 introduced in the eastern half of Lanai, and D0 was replaced by D1 over the western half.</p>
   <p>In Puerto Rico, most of the island was drier than normal this week.  With continued dryness extending out to 90 days, continued drying soils, low streamflow at some stations, and concern about well levels (especially in Salinas), D0 and D1 were expanded on the main island and D1 was added to Vieques Island.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="High Plains">
   <p>Half an inch to over 2 inches of precipitation fell across much of the High Plains region this week.  But there were some strips which received 0.25 inch or less, including parts of eastern Nebraska, northern North Dakota, southwestern Wyoming, and southeastern Colorado.  D0 expanded in the northern counties of North Dakota.  Soil moisture in northwest North Dakota was dry and planting has been slow, with the dry soils expected to delay planting further and delay germination; fire danger has also been high recently.  Grasses in western North Dakota were showing stress.  In central North Dakota, grass was brown and not growing even though the wetlands were filled with water and dugouts were at normal levels.  In Colorado, on the other hand, recent precipitation, low evaporative demand in recent weeks, improving long-term moisture conditions, and hydrologic rebound from snowmelt prompted reduction of D0 in the remaining areas of the state.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Midwest">
   <p>The storm systems left western portions of the Midwest wetter than normal, but much of the Ohio Valley to eastern Great Lakes, as well as a strip along northern Minnesota, were drier than normal.  Like the Northeast, most of the Midwest has seen prolonged long-term wet conditions.  But persistent dryness in northwest Minnesota for the last 7 days to 24 months resulted in the introduction of D0.  Parts of Kentucky extending into western Tennessee have also been drier than normal for the last 7 days to 2 months.  This area remained free of drought and abnormal dryness this week, but it will be watched for possible D0 if the rains don’t return.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Northeast">
   <p>Half an inch to locally 2 inches of precipitation fell across parts of the Northeast, with the northern portions being wetter than normal.  The southern half of the Northeast was drier than normal, with the driest areas being western New York and extreme southeast Pennsylvania.  Wet conditions have dominated most of the Northeast for the last several months, so the region was free of abnormal dryness or drought.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="South">
   <p>Much of Oklahoma and parts of Texas to the Lower Mississippi Valley were wetter than normal this week, but southern and eastern portions of the region were drier than normal.  Parts of north central Tennessee and western and southern Texas have been drier than normal for the last 60 to 90 days, but otherwise wet conditions dominate the region.  Spots of D0 were added to western Texas along the Rio Grande River, southern Texas, and Mississippi and Tennessee where they connect to Alabama.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southeast">
   <p>The week was drier and warmer than normal across the Southeast.  Coastal sections from North Carolina to Georgia have had precipitation deficits mounting for the last 4 months.  D0 expanded in the eastern Carolinas and western Georgia.  D1 expanded in parts of Georgia; reports have been received of slim grazing in Bleckley County, drying soils in Sumter, Terrell, and Dougherty Counties, and wilting corn in Terrell County.  D0 was added to parts of Alabama.  The soil hydrology in Alabama is characterized by poor water holding capability; as a result, this time of year the vegetation requires significant amounts of moisture which can quickly dry out soils during a 10-day stretch of no rain.  There were reports that shallow rooted vegetation was already under stress in the dry areas of Alabama.  According to May 19th reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), topsoil moisture was deteriorating across the Southeast, with the percent of the state experiencing short to very short (dry to very dry) soil moisture conditions increasing from 4% of Alabama last week to 12% this week; from 16% of Florida last week to 42% this week; from 20% of Georgia last week to 41% this week; and from 13% of South Carolina last week to 48% this week.  Subsoil moisture was short to very short for 9% of Alabama, 33% of Florida, 22% of Georgia, and 34% of South Carolina.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="West">
   <p>It was a cooler- and wetter-than-normal week across most of the West.  Precipitation amounts ranged from less than a tenth of an inch from inland southern California to southern New Mexico, and less than half an inch in the lee areas of the coastal, Sierra, and Great Basin ranges, to over 2 inches in California and parts of the Pacific Northwest.  The areas receiving less than a tenth of an inch of precipitation were drier than normal, as were northwest Washington and parts of northern Idaho and northwest Montana. The precipitation that has occurred during this past wet season contracted drought across the West over the past several months, with just a few areas remaining.  D0-D1 contracted in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, and the D2 in northwest New Mexico was eliminated.  D0 contracted in southeast Oregon.  But D0 expanded in southwest New Mexico and D1 expanded in northwest Oregon and northwest Washington.  May 19th USDA reports indicated 50% of New Mexico was still experiencing short to very short topsoil moisture conditions, and 50% of California was still short of topsoil moisture. In southern California, where D0 remained, 5 of the reservoirs in San Diego County were at or below 50% of capacity.  In spite of the precipitation this week, much of western Washington and northwest Oregon were drier than normal for the last 14 to 90 days, and even out to the last 12 months.  Streamflow levels were low, with the streamflow on the Wilson River near Tillamook, Oregon near record low levels for this time of year.</p>
