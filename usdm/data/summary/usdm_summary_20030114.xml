  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During January 15 - 20, moderate precipitation (0.25 to locally near 1.0 inch) is forecast for some of the areas currently experiencing dryness or drought, specifically part of central Washington, the northern Idaho Panhandle and northwestern Montana, parts of the east-central Rockies, a swath from the northern High Plains southeastward through the middle Mississippi Valley, central sections of Illinois and Indiana, the Lower and western Upper Peninsulas of Michigan, and central Ohio. Other areas should receive little or no precipitation.</p>
   <p>The ensuing 5 days (January 21 - 25) favor above-normal precipitation in the northern Rockies, the northern and central High Plains, and the dry areas in the western Great Plains. In contrast, below-normal totals are anticipated in most of California and Nevada, the dry areas in the eastern Great Plains, the upper and middle Mississippi Valley, and the southern and western sections of the Great Lakes region.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Light to locally moderate precipitation fell on the archipelago, maintaining D0, D0AF, D1, and D1W conditions as they were last week. From late October to mid-January, Honolulu, Oahu and Kahului, Maui received approximately 0.5 to 1.5 inch of rain compared to normals exceeding 7 inches for the period. For the same time frame, Lihue, Kauai received only about one-third of its typical 13 inches, and Hilo on the Big Island recorded about 20 inches less than its normal of 36 inches.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Puerto Rico">
   <p>Once again, an uneventful week led to D0 conditions persisting across all but parts of central and northwestern Puerto Rico. On January 14, 8 of Puerto Rico's 24 regularly-reporting streamflow observing sites reported record low flows for the date, more than on any other date during the recent dry spell. One site, on the Rio Grande de Loiza at Quebrada Arenas, was at an all-time low for any date since measurements started there in 1977.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The East">
   <p>Little or no precipitation fell on Maine last week, prompting D0W expansion into the Longfellow Mountains and adjacent areas, and deterioration to D1W in lower northwestern Maine. Several weeks of deficient precipitation have exacerbated long-term moisture shortages from which the region never fully recovered, having missed many of the systems that brought autumn and early winter drought relief to other parts of the central and northern Atlantic Seaboard.</p>
   <p>Farther south, light precipitation at best was reported in the southern Atlantic states, keeping D0W conditions unchanged from last week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes">
   <p>Little or no precipitation fell on the High Plains, the Great Plains north of Texas, the Mississippi Valley, and the Great Lakes region except for some localized lake-effect snows. As a result, dryness and drought persisted or worsened last week. D0AW and D1AW spread slightly northward in southern Wisconsin, central and northern Iowa, and adjacent areas in Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota. Farther south, D0AW and D1AW crept southward in central and east-central Illinois, D1AW encroached on extreme southwestern Missouri and parts of interior eastern Kansas, and D2AW pushed into parts of northeastern Missouri, southeastern Nebraska, and northeastern Kansas. There continues to be a marked lack of snow cover from the Ohio Valley, middle Mississippi Valley, and eastern Great Plains northward to the Canadian border, including the Great Lakes region.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and Far West">
   <p>Moderate precipitation (generally 1 to 3 inches) brought an end to D0A conditions in far northwestern Washington, and slightly reduced D0W to D2W coverage in south-central Oregon, extreme northeastern California, and northwesternmost Nevada. Unfortunately, none of the other dry areas across the country received enough precipitation to abet any substantial recovery, and in fact conditions deteriorated in several areas, primarily (but not exclusively) from the Rockies westward.</p>
   <p>Light to locally moderate precipitation (0.25 to 1 inch with scattered higher amounts) fell on central and southwestern Arizona, northern Nevada, parts of eastern Oregon, central and eastern Washington, the lower Idaho Panhandle, west-central Montana, parts of southern Idaho, and a few areas in western and north-central Colorado. Other areas received little or no precipitation. As a result, snowpack water content remained steady or declined almost region-wide relative to typical mid-January conditions, with most basins reporting 50% to 75% of normal. In the dry areas from the Rockies westward, near- to above-normal snowpack water content was confined to parts of central and northeastern New Mexico, and a few basins across the southern Idaho interior.</p>
   <p>The dryness has drawn down reservoirs throughout the region. Statewide storage totals for major reservoirs at the end of December were below half of normal for the date in Nevada and New Mexico, and only slightly more than 50% of normal in Oregon, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. Portions of Idaho and Montana have similar conditions, but statewide storage totals across the northern tier of the West are a bit higher than they are farther south.</p>
   <p>Based on these facts, drought conditions deteriorated in a number of areas from the Rockies westward. D4W expanded into central and southeastern Wyoming while D3W was introduced in portions of west-central Montana, east-central and southeastern Idaho, northwestern Wyoming, northwestern Utah, and a small section of Arizona near Phoenix. In addition, D2W spread slightly southeastward into east-central Arizona and northwestern New Mexico, and both D1W and D2W expanded slightly northward and/or northwestward in northeastern Oregon southeastern Washington, the Idaho Panhandle, and northwestern and north-central Montana. Finally, D0W was pulled westward into parts of northwestern Oregon and adjacent Washington.</p>
   <p>We have reached the mid-point of the October-April snowpack recharge season, and many areas across the West and Rockies need to start receiving heavier and more-regular precipitation soon to avoid serious drought impacts during the ensuing summer and autumn.</p>
