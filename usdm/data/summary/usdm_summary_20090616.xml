  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <intro>
   <p>Beneficial precipitation fell this week predominantly in a swath from northern California and Oregon all the way to the mid-Atlantic and up into New England.  Precipitation also fell throughout western New Mexico, northern Texas, and parts of the south.  Little precipitation fell along the Gulf of Mexico, in southern Texas, or in the Southwest.</p>
  </intro>
  <forecast>
   <p>Above normal precipitation is expected from the northern Midwest, through the northern Great Lakes, and throughout the mid-Atlantic and New England June 18 - 22.  Additional precipitation is expected in the West, stretching from Idaho down into Arizona.  Summer thunderstorm activity is expected in Florida.  In intense drought areas, such as Texas, little relief is expected.  Temperatures are expected to be above normal extending from the Southeast to the mid-Atlantic and westward to the Plains.  The west coast is largely expected to see below normal temperatures during this period.</p>
   <p>For the ensuing 5 days (June 23-27, 2009), the odds favor cooler-than-normal conditions along both the east and west coasts.  The interior of the country, centered on the Plains, is expected to see above normal temperatures.  Precipitation is likewise expected to be above normal on the east coast as well as in the Northwest and from New Mexico up into Wyoming.  Below normal precipitation is expected along the Gulf of Mexico from Mississippi to Texas and up through Iowa.  Odds favor wet and cool conditions in northwest Alaska.</p>
  </forecast>
  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Drought conditions remained unchanged across the Hawaiian Islands, in Alaska, and in Puerto Rico.  With the exception of the Big Island, little rain fell in Hawaiian drought areas.  Similarly, little precipitation fell in the drought areas in Alaska. Heavy precipitation again fell in Puerto Rico this week, particularly along the northern and eastern coasts.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The East">
   <p>Moderate to much above normal precipitation (2 inches or more) fell in the Northeast with the highest totals falling in central New York (4 plus inches).  Western Pennsylvania and extreme western New York and Cape Cod missed the most of the precipitation and abnormal dryness (D0) expanded in these areas.</p>
   <p>Rain fell last week throughout much of the mid-Atlantic and down from northern Mississippi and Alabama to North Carolina.  The area of abnormal dryness in North Carolina largely missed the beneficial precipitation and remains unchanged in this week’s depiction.  Above normal precipitation across northern New Jersey, northeast Pennsylvania, and southern New York eliminated the abnormal dryness (D0) there.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Great Lakes Region">
   <p>Most of the drought-affected areas of the region missed the beneficial precipitation that fell just to their south and east.  Continued long-term deficits resulted in largely unchanged drought classifications in this region.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest and Plains">
   <p>This week’s precipitation was highly variable through the Plains.  North Dakota saw little rain while large areas from South Dakota down to northern Oklahoma and parts of northern Texas saw much above normal precipitation.  Southern Texas and much of Oklahoma missed this precipitation.  In Oklahoma, abnormal dryness expanded in the south while contracting slightly in the north.  Moderate drought (D1) also expanded in the panhandle and central part of the state.  Locally heavy precipitation fell in northeast Oklahoma, southeast Kansas, and into central Missouri with totals above 2 inches for the week.</p>
   <p>Extreme (D3), Severe (D2), and Moderate (D1) drought conditions improved in northern Texas while abnormal dryness (D0) and Extreme drought (D3) expanded along the Gulf of Mexico.  At this time, 33 percent of Texas pasture and rangeland is categorized as poor to very poor and 34 percent is categorized as good to excellent, about what would be expected at this time of year, on average.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Above normal precipitation once again fell from northern California and Oregon, across northern Nevada and southern Idaho, and into Colorado and Wyoming.  A second swath of above normal precipitation fell from western New Mexico up into southern Colorado.  This beneficial precipitation eased severe (D2) and moderate drought (D1) as well as abnormal dryness in northern Nevada and southern Oregon.  Moderate drought (D1) and abnormal dryness (D0) expanded slightly in northern Montana, which largely missed the precipitation this week.</p>
