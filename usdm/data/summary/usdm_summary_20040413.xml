  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather developments that may have an impact on dry or drought areas in the next 2 weeks include: 1) due for a breather, the West could get one over the next 5 days ending April 19th as the Pacific NW, Intermountain West, Great Basin and northern Rockies could see good precipitation develop. California and the Pacific NW can expect to see a cool-off as well with below-normal readings expected; 2) the northern Plains and upper Midwest (in and around the Great Lakes) could also see 1-2 inches by early next week; 3) temperatures in the Desert Southwest, Rocky spine, Great Plains and Midwest are expected to be well above normal with the warmest temperatures expected (+10 to 12F) in the central Plains over the next 5 days; 4) looking out further, the 6-10 day (5/20-24) and 8-14 (5/22-28) day forecasts are calling for above-normal temperatures for most of the country except for Pacific coastal locales; 5) precipitation over the same period is expected to be above normal for most of the West (note that northern Colorado, Wyoming and most of Montana are expected to be below normal), the Plains, and Midwest as well; 6) for Alaska, the 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks are showing better odds of cooler temperatures and normal to below-normal precipitation within the abnormally dry region.</p>

  <region name="Alaska">
   <p>No changes of note in the long-term dryness seen in southeastern Alaska this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Upper Midwest">
   <p>The region enjoyed a rather quiet week with cooler temperatures and drier weather dominating Easter weekend. One area of improvement was noted along the Oklahoma/Arkansas border, where 2-4 inches fell last week, leading to some shrinking of the persistent abnormally dry (D0) conditions found stretching between the Arkansas and Red River basins.</p>
   <p>In the Midwest, conditions have again soured as annual and longer time frames have been dry. A slight expansion of severe drought (D2) is noted in north central Minnesota. Abnormally dry (D0) and moderate drought (D1) have also pushed to the east in Minnesota into the Duluth area. Although a lot of impacts arent currently being reported, poor subsoil moisture conditions (statewide report shows 60% of states subsoil moisture as short-very short) could come into play later this summer as much of Minnesota has seen only 50-70% of their normal precipitation dating back to October of 2003. In addition, a lack of moisture this fall, winter, and early spring has led to the development of abnormally dry conditions in northern Indiana, northwestern Ohio and southern Michigan. Again, not a lot of impacts to report yet, but the situation bears watching.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South">
   <p>Bucking the recent year-to-date dryness, decent rains forged into many areas of the Southeast this week, especially within the western Gulf Coast states. Louisiana welcomed the reprieve to the dryness that had been expanding as of late. Some 2-4 inches or more were reported over many locations in southern locales. Northern Mississippi and northern Alabama also saw some good rains roll in. Most of the better rains fell north of the abnormally dry (D0) line across the region, but the rain did lead to the removal of D0 in all but extreme eastern Louisiana, and the D0 was pushed a bit south in central Mississippi and Alabama as a result.</p>
   <p>Farther east, lighter rains led to no changes in Georgia or northern Florida, while strong thunderstorms swept across southern Florida early this week, leading to the removal of the abnormally dry (D0) conditions there.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Last week brought more above-normal temperatures and dry weather for most of the West, the exceptions being Wyoming and Colorado, which saw some good snows and moisture. The long-term situation is such that even with the good precipitation this week, Wyoming saw its state-wide snow water equivalent (SWE) levels drop. In essence, the central Rockies held their ground against the drought. Accordingly, the drought depiction remains unchanged over most of Wyoming and Colorado.</p>
   <p>To the south, however, New Mexico is beginning to see some changes for the better because of good year-to-date moisture and water year amounts as well, mainly in the eastern and southeastern reaches of the state where moderate (D1) and severe (D2) drought have been pushed westward and extreme drought (D3) has been forced west of the Rio Grande. Four good months do not erase four bad years, however.</p>
   <p>The general theme in the West during the past six weeks has been the unusual warmth, which has lead to a record-paced downward spiral as far as snowpack and SWE are concerned. Most basins in most of the states are below average and are seeing an early peak in their runoff. This does not bode well as the normal peak pack season has passed in the coastal states and is rapidly approaching in the Rockies. Many of the basins are reporting snow water content levels 50-80% of normal for this time of year from New Mexico up to Montana and over to the Sierra Cascades.</p>
   <p>As a result, many changes are depicted in the West on this weeks map, starting with the advance of abnormally dry (D0) conditions up the San Joaquin Valley into the Bay area of California and then over to the Sierra Nevada range. Elsewhere, moderate (D1) and severe (D2) drought have pushed westward in Nevada to the Sierra Nevadas and into extreme northeast California because of dry seasonal, year-to-date, and water year totals. In Idaho, the extreme drought (D3) and exceptional drought (D4) have swelled again in its mid-section to the south and east and into extreme northern Utah. Extreme drought (D3) is again slowly working its way back eastward in southern Montana.</p>
