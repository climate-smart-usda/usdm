  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>The forecast for the next five days (through November 15) is showing the potential for beneficial precipitation across central and eastern Kansas, Oklahoma and eastern Texas. The rest of the country looks to remain relatively dry over that period. As far as temperatures go, readings are expected to well below normal across the western half of the country, including the western and high Plains. For those of you east of the Mississippi River, temperatures are expected to be much warmer than last week, with the forecast calling for above-normal readings (3-6 degrees).</p>
   <p>The CPC 6-10 day forecast (November 16-20) calls for at least better odds of below-normal temperatures for virtually the entire country as a large trough may set up in the country’s mid-section, ushering in cooler Canadian air as far as the Gulf Coast states. The best bet for these cooler readings is in the central and northern Plains along with the front range of the Rockies and the Midwest/Great Lakes region. Most of Alaska looks to be below normal as well. Precipitation is more of a mixed bag, with below-normal amounts predicted for eastern Alaska, the Pacific Coast, parts of the Southwest and the southern high Plains centered on west Texas. Above-normal precipitation is more likely in the northern Plains and across most of the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and southern New England.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>After some good trade rains and improvements over the past couple of weeks, Hawaii remains unchanged this week.</p>
   <p>Alaska saw some decent rains (3-5 inches) along the eastern half of the Alexander Archipelago chain, leading to some reduction of D0 there (although the D0 remains along the western flank of the Archipelago). Continued dryness over the past three to four months leads to some expansion of D0 along the entire southern Gulf of Alaska coastal region (45-70 % of normal over the past 90 days) as well as some expansion of D0 in central Alaska to the south and west over to the Norton Sound as totals fall behind by 1-2 + inches (55-70% of normal) over the past 90 days.</p>
   <p>Puerto Rico remains free and clear of D0-D4 at this time, unchanged from last week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Texas and Oklahoma">
   <p>Aside from northeast Texas, it was a dry week across most of Oklahoma and the rest of Texas. Areas that received anywhere from 1.5 to 3 inches of rain in northeast Texas were reduced from D0 to all clear this week. Some other areas of Texas saw some expansion this past week as the dryness now stretches back past 90 days to 6 months or so. In southeast Texas, the D1 has begun to push both west and south into the Austin region. Pasture and range conditions along with top soil moisture are also affected in this region. In western Texas, an expansion of D0-D2 is seen as a push from the Big Bend area to the east, north and south into more of central Texas.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest and Great Lakes">
   <p>A quieter pattern ensued this past week, with generally cooler temperatures and little rainfall leading to status quo across Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee and Illinois. One region that continues to fall behind is in the Bootheel region of Missouri and northeastern Arkansas. An expansion of D1-D3 is noted here as the dryness has been entrenched for at least 6 months now, leading to severely drawn down or empty stock ponds and very little in the way of forage on pastures in this region.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic">
   <p>Cooler than normal temperatures and some beneficial precipitation fell across the region this past week, leading to some changes on the current map. The D0 has been removed in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, but the rains stayed away from New Jersey for the most part, leaving D0 intact there. The Allegheny and Shenandoah Mountains along the West Virginia and Virginia border saw decent rains this past week, leading to some minor reduction of D0-D1 and a removal of the D2 that was in place across the West Virginia Panhandle as short- and long-term deficits begin to ease somewhat. Much cooler weather (5-10 degrees below-normal) and little in the way of rains leaves the Carolinas unchanged this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>The high and dry pattern across the central Plains led to some expansion of D0 across central Nebraska, spreading into more of central Kansas as well. In addition, the severe dryness felt across west-central Kansas over the past 90 days has led to expansion of D1 out of east-central Colorado and into Kansas. The rest of the region remains unchanged this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast and Gulf Coast">
   <p>Southern Alabama and Georgia remained on the short end of any significant rainfall over the past week, leading to a slight push northward of D1-D2 in southeast Georgia in and around Savannah. The rest of Georgia remains unchanged this week. To the west in Alabama, the southern portion of the state continues to miss out on the rains they are seeing to the north, leading to further deterioration of the D2-D3 in southeastern Alabama. D1 continues to be eroded away in north and east-central Alabama after a more favorable weather pattern the past couple of weeks. Eastern and northern Mississippi reported their best rainfall totals during the past seven days, with beneficial totals ranging from 1 to 4 inches. This has helped reduce the D3, D2 and D1 conditions found in most eastern and northern counties of the state. On the heels of last week’s heavy rains across southern Louisiana, more rains this week bring more reductions of D0-D3 in the southern parishes of the state. On November 3, the state lifted a statewide burn ban that had been in place over the past month.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>It was another relatively warm and dry week for all but the coastal ranges along the Pacific Ocean from California up to Washington State. The only relevant change on the map this week is found in Colorado, where seasonal dryness on the order of 90 days or so is quite impressive, leading to an expansion of D0 and D1 across more of the eastern and southern counties.</p>
