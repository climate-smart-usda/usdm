  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather events that may have an impact on abnormally dry or drought areas during the next 5 days (July 24-28) include: 1) A strong ridge of high pressure will remain parked over the West, maintaining a pattern of above-normal temperatures. Nevertheless, monsoon showers may provide limited drought relief in the Four Corners States, while only isolated showers are expected elsewhere in the West; 2) A series of disturbances crossing the Midwestern and Great Lakes States will maintain the threat of sporadic showers and thunderstorms. Meanwhile, occasionally heavy showers are likely in northern New England; 3) Hot weather is expected to return to the Plains, where widespread precipitation is not expected. However, isolated thunderstorms may develop by week's end on the northern and central Plains.</p>
   <p>The 6- to 10-day outlook for July 29 - August 2 calls for a continuation of cooler-than-normal weather across much of the eastern half of the U.S., but a persistence of above-normal temperatures in the West. Mostly dry weather will accompany the heat across the northern Plains and Northwest, but near- to above-normal precipitation may provide some drought relief across the southern Plains and Southwest.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Alaska">
   <p>No changes in the drought depiction were noted in Hawaii, where a brief period of locally heavy showers interrupted an otherwise warm, dry weather pattern. On July 18-19, 24-hour rainfall totals on the Big Island included 2.31 inches in Honokaa and 1.63 inches in Laupahoehoe. Meanwhile, Alaska experienced a stunning reversal in temperatures from record warmth to a record chill, followed by a return to warm weather. Widespread precipitation fell across east-central Alaska during the transition period, resulting in some reductions in the areal extent of abnormal dryness (D0). Fairbanks received a daily-record rainfall of 0.66 inch on July 15, helping to boost its July 1-22 total to 1.86 inches (156 percent of normal) and year-to-date sum to 3.98 inches (87 percent). Denali National Park headquarters received its first measurable  July snowfall on record, netting 1 inch on July 16-17.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Great Lakes Region">
   <p>Variable rainfall patterns resulted in some minor reconfiguration of abnormal dryness (D0) in Wisconsin and Michigan. Slight expansions of dryness were noted in northern Wisconsin and southeastern Lower Michigan, while some additional reductions were observed in northern Minnesota.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>Another cool week with widespread showers eliminated concerns about agricultural dryness (D0) in Vermont and northern New York. Rainfall was especially heavy on July 21-22, when the 24-hour total reached 2.00 inches in Morrisville, Vermont. Farther east, however, the rains were not enough to significantly dent long-term precipitation deficits across much of New Hampshire and Maine. A small area of moderate drought (D1) persisted in northern Maine.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Following several more days of excessive heat, cooler air spread across the majority of the Plains by July 22. However, hot weather lingered on the northern High Plains, where Helena, MT, recorded its first-ever streak of four consecutive days (July 17-20) with high temperatures at or above 100 degrees F. Elsewhere in Montana, temperatures peaked at 101 degrees F in Great Falls on the same four days, representing the city's first four-day spell of triple-digit heat since 1933. On the central and southern Plains, only isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms accompanied the cool air's arrival, leaving many pastures and summer crops in need of moisture. July heat on the Plains has caused a rapid depletion of soil moisture and  increased stress on pastures and summer crops. In some cases, high temperatures during summer crop reproduction may have been more stressful than underlying soil moisture conditions, making real-time assessment of the situation difficult until the crops reach a later stage of development.</p>

  <region name="The West">
   <p>The remnants of Claudette became embedded in the monsoon circulation but provided only a minimal enhancement of shower activity. However, the arrival of the summer rainy season brought slightly cooler weather to the Southwest and prevented significant expansion of existing drought. Farther north, however, dry weather and temperatures as much as 10 degrees F above normal brought a broad expansion of drought at levels ranging from moderate to exceptional (D1 to D4). The Intermountain West and Southwest reported both agricultural and hydrological drought effects, with the latter type dominant in many locations. Hydrological concerns necessitated an expansion of exceptional drought (D4) westward across southern Idaho, northeastern Nevada, and extreme southeastern Oregon. Meanwhile, abnormal agricultural dryness (D0) continued to affect the Northwest, with some areas approaching the threshold of drought. For example, 27 percent of Washington's dryland spring wheat was rated very poor to poor on July 20, according to the latest weekly report from USDA/NASS.</p>
   <p>Elsewhere in the Northwest, Boise, Idaho, noted a daily-record high of 108 degrees F on July 22, marking its eighth consecutive day with triple-digit heat. Boise's previous record of 7 consecutive days was established in July 1960. Meanwhile in Colorado, Pueblo's record-setting streak of 9 consecutive days of triple-digit heat ended with a high of 90 degrees F on July 22 (the previous record of 8 days was set from June 24 - July 2, 1990), but Grand Junction's streak reached 12 days (July 11-22), breaking its July 2002 record of 10 days. In addition, records for the greatest number of days in any month with temperatures of 100 degrees F or higher were tied or broken in locations such as Grand Junction (17 days through July 22, surpassing 14 days in July 2002) and Boise (11 days, tying July 1960).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Western Gulf Coast">
   <p>Hurricane Claudette helped to eradicate a residual area of abnormal dryness along and near the middle Texas coast. Although Claudette moved rapidly westward after making landfall and was not a prolific rainfall producer by tropical standards, a few locations just inland near the storm's track recorded totals in excess of 5 inches.</p>
