  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features through February 23 that may impact dry or drought areas include: 1) A series of slow-moving storm systems should track through the eastern half of the Nation Tuesday-Friday, producing significant precipitation from eastern Texas to the mid-Atlantic; however, these systems (and its rainfall) should stay well north of Florida and eastern sections of Georgia and South Carolina; 2) Light precipitation and colder conditions are predicted for the Pacific Northwest through Monday, with higher precipitation amounts possible farther south in southern Oregon and northern California; 3) Tropical moisture south of Hawaii should enhance windward showers Tuesday-Thursday, then drier conditions should prevail into next week. 4) The 6 to 10-day outlook (for Feb. 19-23) calls for above-normal precipitation in the Southwest and New England, and subnormal precipitation in the Nations midsection and along the Gulf Coast, including Florida.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>A fetch of tropical moisture ahead of a deep trough west of Hawaii greatly enhanced windward showers, particularly on Kauai, Oahu, and the Big Island. February 8-12 totals included 10-14 inches across northern Kauai, 2-5 inches in northern and eastern Oahu, 1-3 inches in northeastern Maui, and 4-12 inches at windward locations of the Big Island. The rainfall was widespread and heavy enough to reduce drought or eliminate abnormal dryness in some of the aforementioned areas; however, only light showers (less than 0.5 inches) fell on leeward sections, keeping drought intact. In Puerto Rico, drier weather returned to the island after several consecutive weeks of unseasonably heavy showers, maintaining abnormal dryness along the southwestern coast.</p>

  <region name="The Central Appalachians">
   <p>Light precipitation (0.3-0.6") maintained abnormal dryness (D0) in Pennsylvania, but lower totals (&lt;0.3") and temperatures averaging 9 to 12F above normal expanded moderate drought (D1) into southern West Virginia and severe drought (D2) into southwestern Virginia. The USGS 7-day averaged streamflows dropped to near-record low early February levels in the latter two areas as October2000-January 2001 precipitation percentiles were less than 2%.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Midwest">
   <p>A significant winter storm tracked across the central Plains and the Midwest on February 8-9, producing more than 2 inches of precipitation in many locations from eastern Kansas to Lower Michigan. As a result, an area of severe drought (D2) across the east-central Plains improved to moderate drought (D1). Slightly lighter amounts of precipitation (generally 1 to 2 inches) were observed from central Kansas to Michigans Upper Peninsula, eradicating abnormally dry (D0) conditions in the latter region and bringing further drought reduction in the central Plains and Midwest. Farther south, dry weather prevailed across southeastern New Mexico and southwestern Texas, leaving long-term dryness/drought well-entrenched. Areas in and around Midland, Texas, where severe drought (D2) persists, have received chronically below-normal amounts of precipitation since 1994. Severe drought (D2) also continues across Montanas High Plains, with lesser degrees of dryness/drought (D0 and D1) affecting adjacent areas. Hydrological concerns (D0) persist in western and southwestern Nebraska.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Several fast-moving storm systems brought beneficial precipitation to most of the Southeast, especially from northeastern Texas to southeastern Tennessee, and in eastern South Carolina where 1-3" of rain fell. The precipitation eased or eliminated drought in Mississippi and western Alabama where surplus precipitation has occurred since November. However, another week of near to below-normal precipitation and above-normal temperatures along most of the Atlantic Coastal Plains and in the southern Appalachians kept or expanded dryness and drought in these regions, particularly Florida. Little or no rain, highs in the 80's, and winter freezes which have increased dry fuels have escalated wildfire danger across much of the state, including a 20,000 acre fire in the southwestern corner of near-record low Lake Okeechobee (east of Moore Haven, FL) that is normally marshy. In addition, the hydrological (W) depiction was moved northward as fire (F) and agricultural (A) impacts have become more relevant as Spring approaches, except in the central Gulf coast states where only hydrological impacts are a concern (topsoil moisture is adequate).</p>

  <region name="The West">
   <p>Recent storms added about 3 inches of water equivalent to the Sierra Nevada snow pack, according to February 13 data from the California Department of Water Resources. Nevertheless, the state snow-survey average of 13 inches is only a little over 60 percent of the mid-February average, thus maintaining D0(W) in the Sierra Nevada. Farther north, the Cascades and northern Rockies recorded another week of light precipitation, with approximately two-thirds of their wet season already completed. Data from USDAs SNOTEL network indicate that precipitation since October 1 is generally averaging 45-75%, and the February 13 basin snow water equivalent ranged between 35-65%. Quoting from the Washington State Water Supply Outlook, Washington state snowpack and precipitation is near record low levels. Streamflow forecasts for the upper Columbia River region are all drastically low...the lack of precipitation has also reduced available reservoir storage to precariously low levels. Accordingly, moderate drought (D1) was expanded to encompass Washington and most of Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Although northwest Oregon was included in the new D1(W) area based upon the well-below normal seasonal precipitation, its water supply is heavily dependent upon Spring precipitation, allowing for a better chance of improvement there during the next few months. Even at lower elevations of the Pacific Northwest, less than 60% of normal October 1-February 12 precipitation totals were widespread, including Eugene, OR (11.22", or 36%), Salem, OR (11.31", or 47%), Olympia, WA (16.66", or 53%), and Seattle, WA (12.67", or 57%).</p>
