  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>The official 5-day NWS forecast issued on May 24 calls for heavy rains (3 to 5 inches) over eastern and southern Iowa and northwestern Missouri on May 24-29, with 1 to 3 inches over most of the Midwest Corn Belt. The latest 6 to 10-day forecast sees above-normal rainfall during May 30 to June 3 for the upper Midwest. Though this would not be enough rain to eliminate deficits that took up to 12 months to develop, the moisture should have a significant impact on the drought. In the next 2 weeks, severe drought (D2) in Iowa should retreat southward to near the border with Missouri, while the D2 drought in eastern Iowa and northwestern Illinois should also retreat southward to near the Missouri border. The D2 drought should shrink in Missouri, while the forecast rains could bring the D3 drought in southeast Nebraska and northwest Missouri down to D2.</p>
   <p>The 5-day forecast issued on May 24 calls for some relief in northern parts, with up to 1 inch in northern parts of Georgia and Alabama, but amounts will decrease southward to the Gulf. Given near to above-normal temperatures forecast over the entire region in the next 10 days and below-normal rainfall for days 6 to 10 over much of the Southeast, little change in drought conditions can be expected.</p>
   <p>No significant changes to drought area are expected in the next 2 weeks, though forecast high temperatures and little rainfall will intensify dryness over the Southwest.</p>
   <p>For Hawaii, no significant changes are expected in the next 2 weeks. In Puerto Rico, showers will continue to reduce the dryness.</p>
  </forecast>
  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Heavy rains reduced dryness in eastern Puerto Rico, though dryness (D0) persisted along the north coastal strip. Little rain fell in Hawaii, allowing D1 and D2 drought to persist in the leeward areas.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Midwest">
   <p>Severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy rains (3 to 5 inches) swept across the northern Corn Belt on May 17-19, eliminating drought in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and most of Michigan. One to 3-inch totals in northern Iowa and northern Nebraska were not enough to end drought (D1 and D2) but offered some relief. Amounts of 1 inch or less falling farther south allowed severe drought (D2) to persist from southern Iowa into much of Missouri and westward into eastern Nebraska. Severe hydrological drought (D2W) and first-stage agricultural drought (D1A) also extended eastward into central Illinois. Drought has been upgraded to D3 (extreme) from extreme southeastern Nebraska into northwest Missouri and extreme northeast Kansas. In the northern part of the severe drought zone, including northern Iowa, northeastern Nebraska, and central Illinois, the drought has led to low subsoil moisture levels, but recent timely rains in this area and across much of the Midwest have benefitted crops. The national corn crop is rated 70 percent good to excellent by USDA. In contrast, most of Missouri picked up less than one-half inch of rain during the week ending May 23, resulting in continued D2 drought for much of the state.</p>

  <region name="South-Central and Southeastern States">
   <p>Heavy thunderstorms on May 18-20 brought another 1 to 4 inches of rain to east Texas, further reducing dryness. Rains, however, barely dented the extreme drought (D3) in southwest Texas. The NWS San Angelo office has reported that the ongoing lack of rainfall has had devastating effects on area reservoirs, with most at or below 20 percent of conservation storage. Extreme drought (D3) continued in south-central and east-central Louisiana, which has seen the driest 24-month period in over 100 years. Fires have burned over 30,000 acres in southern Louisiana since the start of the year. The NWS office in Lake Charles reported that rice production is forecast to fall by nearly 25 percent, at a cost of nearly 90 million dollars. Warm, dry weather caused severe drought (D2) to extend farther northward into South Carolina from Georgia. Conditions have worsened rapidly in South Carolina, with statewide streamflow decreasing 32 percent during May 9-15 and another 34 percent during May 15-22. On May 24, their Department of Natural Resources upgraded the drought status for all 46 counties to first or second level drought. Severe drought persisted into Florida, with intensity upgraded to extreme (D3) levels from the Tampa area northward to the Cedar Key area. The citrus areas are in desperate need of rain, according to USDA, as ponds, canals, and reservoirs dry up.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Drought persisted over central and southern New Mexico and eastern parts of Arizona, with the primary impact on rangeland and fire danger. Precipitation in Wyoming reduced the area of D0 dryness in the north, but drought (D1) expanded northeastward in Montana to the Fort Peck Lake area.</p>
