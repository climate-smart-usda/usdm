  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the coming days or weeks that may affect areas experiencing dryness or drought across the country include: 1) oppressive heat and humidity will continue its hold in parts of the southern Plains, the South and the Southeast through Tuesday, July 24; 2) a cold front moving southeast across the U.S. late this week will allow cooler and drier air from Canada to push south, bringing with it the chances for beneficial rains and relief in drought-affected areas within the Ohio Valley and Southeast; 3) all but the Panhandle of Florida can expect to see further drought relief as a result of significant rains (2 to 6 inches expected) during the next five days ending July 16; 4) in the 6-10 day period (July 17-21), much of the Pacific NW and Southeast can expect cooler than normal temperatures while the Plains and Midwestern states can expect above-normal temperatures. The Pacific NW and most of Montana and Idaho can expect above-normal precipitation along with Florida. Unfortunately, the central and southern Plains states have better odds of seeing below-normal precipitation to go along with the above-normal temperatures; 5) there is an increased chance for windward showers over Hawaii in the next few days; however, a return to dry weather seems likely by early next week.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Drought persists across most of the Hawaiian Islands, with many areas seeing less than 50% of their year-to-date rainfall. This is compounded by the long-term deficits that have accrued over the past three years. Conditions have now worsened over the Big Island, with abnormally dry (D0) and moderate drought (D1) extending to the east coast. Abnormally dry (D0) conditions remain across northeastern Puerto Rico in and around San Juan while the rest of the island continues to benefit from recent rains.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>Abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate drought (D1) remain across parts of Maine and northern New Hampshire and Vermont. Abnormal dryness (D0) has also begun to spread across northwestern Pennsylvania and western New York.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Intense heat (10 or more above normal) coupled with a lack of any significant rainfall has led to the rapid expansion of abnormal dryness (D0) further north and east within Oklahoma and also into western Kansas over the past few weeks. A dominant ridge of high pressure set up over the central and southern Plains, repelling all rainfall and keeping the unwanted heat instead. As expected, the areas of abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate drought (D1) have expanded further into the Texas panhandle and southwestern Oklahoma. All the makings are here for the flash drought to continue to expand and intensify unless this weather pattern is broken soon. Abnormally dry (D0) conditions have spread a little to the east in Nebraska to areas south of the Platte River, while conditions have improved north of the Platte over the past few weeks. Range and pasture conditions are deteriorating quickly over the entire region. In short, the heat is on.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast and Mid-South">
   <p>Most of the region enjoyed a fairly normal week in the way of temperatures and precipitation. An exception to this was the northern portion of the dry areas from the Ohio Valley to the Carolinas. Heavy rains in southern Illinois, Indiana, eastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia and the Carolinas brought about much-needed relief. As a result, abnormally dry (D0) through extreme drought (D3) conditions have improved in these areas. There are no real changes to the Florida drought situation as last week brought normal temperatures and mostly below-normal rainfall to much of the state. For southeast Missouri and northeastern Arkansas, conditions continue to worsen with the heat and lack of rainfall. The dryness has expanded westward in both states.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Most of the region saw a relatively quiet week weatherwise. The Pacific Northwest saw very little if any rain last week, and it wasnt much better for their neighbors to the east in Idaho and Montana. Conditions are primed for forest fires as the region is already experiencing conditions that arent normally seen until late August. The Great Basin area, however, did see some significant rains as parts of eastern California and southern Nevada and Utah welcomed a monsoonal shot in the arm. As a result, all of the drought areas have been pushed back to the north in Nevada and Utah after invading these areas just last week.</p>
   <p>Timely rains in and around Anchorage (almost 3 inches last week) have led to a quick removal or reduction of the abnormally dry (D0) area (which only emerged on the map last week) in east central Alaska.</p>
