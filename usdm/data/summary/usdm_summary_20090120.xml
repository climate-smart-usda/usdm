  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>A more active weather pattern is setting up over the Pacific Ocean, with some much needed precipitation anticipated in areas of the western United States over the next week.  Below normal temperatures in the northern tier should help retain the snowpack in the mountains.  There remains much uncertainty yet among the models for the coming weekend's forecast, with a split flow projected to develop off the west coast and exactly where it will bring most of the precipitation.  The Climate Prediction Center's six to ten day outlook shows below normal temperatures across Alaska and the western states, and above normal temperatures in the south from Texas to Virginia.  The precipitation outlook for the same period calls for dry conditions from Texas to Florida and Alaska, and areas of above normal precipitation in the northern Rockies and the Ohio River Valley.  Looking further ahead into the eight to fourteen day period, the same temperature pattern is set with cooler temperatures in the west and warmer temperatures in the eastern half of the country.  Precipitation is projected to be similar to the six to ten day forecast as well, with drier conditions in Alaska, Plains states and Florida, and wetter conditions in the Pacific Northwest and Ohio River Valley.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Improvements in agricultural impacts warranted removal of D1A on Oahu, and slight reduction of D3 on the Big Island.  Waimanalo Reservoir is slowly rising as well.  In Alaska, D0 was introduced in the Fairbanks area based on the current water year snowfall and precipitation shortages as compared to normal.  Snowfall is currently at 52% of normal, and precipitation at 62% of normal according to the NRCS.  Recent precipitation in the last week on the Seward peninsula was a welcome sight, but long term dryness remains so there were no changes to the D0 extent in the northwest part of the state.  Puerto Rico's eastern interior has also had significant shortages in precipitation this dry season, with upwards of 16 inches deficit in the last 60 and 90 day periods.  D0 was introduced to reflect this.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest and Northeast">
   <p>A reassessment of conditions along the Ohio-Kentucky border justified the removal of D1 in this area.  In the upper peninsula of Michigan, some recent precipitation warranted slight improvements on the Keweenaw peninsula, with reduction of D1.  This area has received above normal precipitation since September, such as 1.45 inches above normal at Ironwood for this period.  Long term dryness remains since August in Houghton, Iron and part of Baraga county, so this area is still in the D1 category.   No changes were made in the northeast this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>The drought in Texas continues to expand, and this week worsening conditions in the east central part of the state brought D0 and D1 designations towards the Houston area.  Precipitation deficits of the last few months, as well as reports of increasing burn bans and poor streamflow are among the factors that were considered.  In west central Texas, further degradation was made, introducing D2 to encompass most of Val Verde county and others, as well as a southern expansion of D2 extent over Maverick and Dimmit counties.  Following on its heels, D3 was expanded as well.</p>
   <p>In the far northern High Plains, western North Dakota was improved to reduce areas of both D1 and D0 , reflecting snowfall in the last 60 and 90 day periods.  The drought area now resides south of the Missouri River.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Record low streamflow and other indicators were motivation to degrade the eastern portion of the drought area in South Carolina this week.  D1 and D2 was extended eastward to reflect this.  Elsewhere in the southeast, no changes were warranted this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Continued high pressure centered over the Great Basin did little to alleviate drought conditions in the West.  In California, D3 was expanded to include all of the Sacramento River basin, reflecting continued lack of precipitation this water year, in combination with two previous dry years.  Department of Water Resources' 8-station northern Sierra precipitation index would need 35 inches to get to normal conditions, yet the average precipitation for February through September is typically just 19 inches. If the current precipitation trend continues, this would result in a three-year period of less than 75 percent of normal.  Similar dry periods have been experienced just three other times in the 20th century: 1932-34, 1987-89, and 1990-92, with the last being most analogous to our current condition.  Major reservoirs and runoff data also show a grim outlook for this area.  In addition to the expansion of D3, D2 was introduced in Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties north of San Francisco to reflect continued lack of precipitation in this area, compounded by the previous two dry years.  D2 was also expanded in the north of the state to include all of the Sacramento River Drainage climate division.</p>
   <p>In Oregon, an area of D0 was placed over I-5 between Eugene and Salem to show precipitation deficits of 30-50 percent in this region over the last year.  Central Washington was reassessed from last week's depiction, and the area of D0 was reduced.  Northern and east central Idaho was also improved from last week, based on decent snowfall totals recently in this region, and to be in agreement with the drought depiction in Montana and other neighboring states.  Both D0 and D1 areas were reduced.</p>
