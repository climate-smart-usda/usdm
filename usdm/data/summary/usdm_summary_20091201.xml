  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>For the ensuing 5 days (December 3-7), a deepening low pressure system over the eastern Great Lakes region will be accompanied by light to moderate rain in New England before it moves into the southern Canadian Maritimes by Friday morning.  In the wake of this storm system, snow showers will affect the traditional snow-belt areas downwind of the Great Lakes. As the associated cold front pushes southward across the Florida peninsula, it will be accompanied by several inches of beneficial rainfall. Over the weekend, a new frontal system will bring light precipitation to the Central Plains and Northern High Plains, while onshore flow across the Texas coast could result in light rainfall for that area.  Rain and mountain snow will overspread Oregon and northern and central California during this weekend as a Pacific storm moves onshore. Mostly dry conditions will prevail over the southern Intermountain region and the interior Northwest.</p>
   <p>The CPC 6-10 day forecast (December 8-12) calls for below-normal temperatures over much of the northern and central contiguous U.S., and eastern Alaska, with above-normal temperatures over Florida, the Southeast coast, the Southwest, and western Alaska.  Above-normal precipitation is anticipated across the Southern Atlantic Coast States and eastern Gulf region, and for a large portion of the West.  Below-normal precipitation is expected over much of the southern and central Great Plains, most of Missouri and Arkansas, and all but far western portions of Alaska.</p>
  </forecast>
  <region name="Central and Northern Plains">
   <p>Mostly dry, warmer-than-normal weather continued during the past week. Lingering effects from an abnormally cool and wet October have somewhat offset Novemberâ€™s very dry and mild weather, thus preventing any additional deterioration to the abnormal dryness in eastern Montana at this time.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Locally heavy windward showers affected parts of the Hawaiian Islands during the past week, but most of the rain fell on areas that were not in drought. Moderate drought (D1) conditions were expanded westward across the Big Island to the Kona coast, based primarily on agricultural impacts. In Alaska, heavy precipitation fell across the southern coastline, but little or no precipitation made it northward into the D0 southeastern interior area. Therefore no changes were made to the current drought designation in Alaska.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Texas">
   <p>Southern and eastern Texas received moderate to heavy rain (generally 0.5 inch to 2 inches, locally up to 5 inches near Corpus Christi) during the week from several cold front passages. These rains have prompted a 1-category improvement in drought intensity in southern Texas, with the removal of exceptional drought (D4) conditions. Despite the recent heavy rain, long-term deficits persist, with 365-day departures still greater than 10 inches across southern-most portions of Texas. Additional 1-category improvements were made to western portions of southern Texas due to the beneficial precipitation.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Mid-Atlantic and Southeast">
   <p>Several cold front passages resulted in light rainfall (less than 0.5 inch) for much of the Carolinas, Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. Heavier rains (1 to 2 inches, with locally higher amounts) fell over peninsular Florida and eastern Virginia. Unfortunately, most of the significant precipitation missed the abnormally dry area straddling the Carolinas. Concerns regarding groundwater tables and long-term precipitation deficits (180- and 365-days) remained, especially in south-central North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina. In contrast, the heavy rain (locally up to 3 inches) that fell across northeastern Florida provided relief from abnormal dryness. In southern Florida, the drought situation is more complicated, with some areas southwest of Lake Okeechobee missing out on the heavier rains. Local data depicted an expansion of moderate drought (D1) conditions for most of Glades County.  In addition, this area is contending with moderate to severe fire danger, something that normally does not occur until February.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>Mild, unsettled conditions prevailed, with weekly rainfall totals between 0.5 inch and 2.0 inches across most of New England, central and far western portions of New York, and central Pennsylvania. A rapidly developing coastal storm (November 27-28) helped concentrate the heavier rainfall amounts closer to the coast and in New England. For the third consecutive week, only light rains (less than 0.5 inches) have fallen on the abnormally dry (D0) area in western Pennsylvania where 7-, 14-, and 28-day average USGS stream flows and soil moisture levels remained below the 30th percentile. Therefore, no changes were made to the current drought depiction in the Northeast.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Although moderate to locally heavy rain and mountain snow (1-2 inch liquid equivalent, with locally higher amounts) fell across western portions of Washington and Oregon, significant precipitation bypassed the interior sections of the Northwest.  Much of California reported light precipitation during the past week, with a few localized areas picking up between 0.5 and 1 inches. The northern third of the state has generally received between 50 and 75 percent of normal precipitation on time scales ranging from the last 7 days to the most recent 12 months. Degradation of drought conditions may be warranted for the northern portions of the Central Valley, and conditions will need to be reassessed early next week. Continued dryness along the border between California and Nevada prompted a slight southward expansion of abnormally dry (D0) and moderate drought (D1) conditions. Reassessment of drought indicators in northern Nevada (such as lack of precipitation, snowpack, and stream flows) has also prompted the eastward expansion of D0 drought conditions into western portions of Elko County. In Arizona, precipitation amounts were mostly light (0.5 inch or less), and data from local experts showed it was not enough to substantially ameliorate drought conditions. Therefore no changes were made to the drought designations in Arizona.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Upper Midwest">
   <p>Once again, the heavier rains fell south and east of the main drought region. At most, about a half-inch of precipitation fell near the western and eastern margins of the Wisconsin and Upper Michigan drought area. Seven day average stream flows in the region are generally within the lowest quartile of the historically observed distribution.</p>
