  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 5 days (February 8-12) the bitter cold air from the north will remain entrenched across most of the eastern half of the country with temperature readings of 10-20 degrees below normal expected in the northern Rockies and northern Plains and 5-10 degrees below normal expected across the southern Plains, the Southeast, and the East. The Southwest and southern regions of the Gulf Coast states are looking at above-normal temperatures while most of California is forecasted to see normal to slightly below normal temperatures.</p>
   <p>As for precipitation during this period, a breaking down of the ridge that has held its grip over California is a good sign as a large portion of the state (all but the deserts in the south) is hoping to benefit from much needed rains and snow on the order of 1-1.5 inches in the south and upwards of 2-4 inches in the Sierras and northern California. Not much relief is shown for the rest of the West for the drought-affected regions except for portions of extreme eastern Idaho and western and southern Montana, where totals of an inch or so may be possible with this next system. Only light to modest totals are expected across the entire mid-section of the country and the East. The same goes for the Southeast, where the best bet for good rains is found in extreme southern Florida and the Keys. Totals here may amount to an inch or two over this period.</p>
   <p>For the ensuing 5 days (February 13-17) temperatures are expected to be below normal for almost the entire United States as a large trough sets up over the eastern half of the country. The exceptions are the Pacific NW, Intermountain Basin and Florida, which are expected to be around normal. All but the Lower Peninsula of Alaska can expect to see above-normal temperatures. As for the precipitation patterns, the southern tier states, and Gulf Coast states in particular, are looking at better odds of above-normal precipitation because of a favorable southerly jet flow overhead while the Pacific NW and Northern Plains states are looking to be drier than normal. Southwestern Alaska is looking at above-normal precipitation and the northwestern regions of the state look to be below normal.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Most of Alaska saw a pretty dry week. The notable dryness and lack of snowfall in the Fairbanks region keeps the D0 situation locked in up there and to the south in the Alaska Range before things get a bit better in and around Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula.</p>
   <p>In Hawaii, the dryness continues for most of the islands (the exceptions being the north coastal regions of Kauai and Hawaii, which saw some decent rains), leading to no changes in the D0 depiction on the map this week.</p>
   <p>The best rains across Puerto Rico over the past week fell over those areas not already shown as D0/D1, keeping the situation as is for another week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest and High Plains">
   <p>The big arctic chill settled in last week as dry, bitterly cold air enveloped the region, keeping drought locked in place for this week and the map unchanged from last week. Temperatures ran, on average, 10 to 20 degrees below normal for the week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South and Southeast">
   <p>A quieter pattern kept most of the region dry last week. Good isolated rains on the order of 1 to 5 inches fell across parts of Floridas north-central and Panhandle regions. The steady diet of recent rains this winter has led to improvements in these areas on this weeks map, with the removal of all D2 and a one-category improvement from the Jacksonville area over to Tallahassee and southward into the counties north of Orlando.</p>
   <p>Things continue to deteriorate this winter in other parts of the Southeast, most notably across the Appalachians. This marked dryness includes central Tennessee, where 6- to 9-inch deficits over the past 90 days have been recorded. This abnormal dryness (D0) extends northward up the range and is marked this week by a slight expansion of D0 into more of Kentucky, extreme western North Carolina, extreme western Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland.</p>
   <p>After recent improvements in the past few weeks, the rest of the South remains unchanged, particularly across Oklahoma and Texas, after a relatively dry week in the drought-affected regions of these states. The coolness of the past week extended down into both Oklahoma and Texas (5 to 15 degrees below normal), helping to keep the hydrological drought in check.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West and Rocky Mountains">
   <p>Most of the West remained dry last week, although some spotty rains on the order of an inch or so were reported across parts of the Southwest in Arizona and New Mexico. The rains were not enough, however, to stave off expansion of D2 in western and southwestern Arizona where Water Year-to-date totals are running 25-50% of normal. Lack of snow in northern Nevada and across most of western and southern Utah has led to an expansion of D0 in these states where snow water equivalent readings are generally below 50% of normal. New Mexico, on the other hand, has fared much better (buoyed by a much better monsoon season than Arizona) and is marked by some reduction of D0 in the northwestern reaches of the state in and around the Zuni and San Mateo Mountain ranges.</p>
   <p>In California, the Sierras remain an area to watch as Water Year precipitation is running well below 50% of normal (8- to 16-inch deficits) and snow water equivalent readings in the upper elevations (according to USDA/NRCS SNOTEL data) are tracking below 40% of normal as of February 6. The drought picture remains steady this week in California as a result of adequate storage at this time and a general lack of impacts, but the odds of receiving enough precipitation to get back to normal are not good in the Sierras, and the impacts will soon follow if the dryness continues.</p>
