  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 10-day period through May 3 which may affect areas experiencing dryness or drought include: over the next 5 days (April 24-28): A storm system centered over the nation's mid-section will drift slowly eastward, reaching the East Coast by April 26. The storm will produce showers and locally heavy thunderstorms across the central and southern Plains and southern portions of the Midwest. Meanwhile, a sprawling Pacific storm system will gradually move inland, providing showery, unsettled weather across northern California, the Northwest, and portions of the Plains and upper Midwest. Areas expected to remain mostly dry through April 28 include the Southwest and the Great Lakes region. For the 6- to 10-day period (April 29 - May 3): 1) Cool, wet weather is likely across California, the Great Basin, and parts of the Intermountain West. Above-normal precipitation is also forecast across the Plains and upper Midwest, accompanied by near- to above-normal temperatures; 2) Below-normal precipitation is forecast in New England, much of the South, and portions of the Rio Grande Valley and Desert Southwest.</p>

  <region name="Alaska">
   <p>Mild, showery weather continued across previously dry areas in southwestern Alaska, where Bethel's April 1-21 precipitation totaled 1.73 inches (368 percent of normal), including 10.9 inches of snow. Little change was observed across the remainder of southern Alaska, much of which remained abnormally dry (D0).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Heavy showers developed across windward sections of the eastern Hawaiian Islands, providing some relief from abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1). On the Big Island, April 15-21 totals included 10.97 inches in Glenwood and 8.55 inches in Piihonua. Elsewhere on the Big Island, Hilo netted 9.27 inches (exactly normal) during the first three weeks of April, boosting its year-to-date rainfall to 17.45 inches (41 percent of normal).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="New England">
   <p>Following a mid-April cold snap, milder weather finally melted much of the remaining snow cover across lower elevations of northern New England. Caribou, Maine, reported a snow depth of a trace on April 21, ending a 155-day span (November 17 - April 20) with at least one inch of snow on the ground. Despite the region's persistent snow cover, precipitation deficits exist across northern New England's area of abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1) at nearly all time scales, ranging from a few weeks to more than two years.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes">
   <p>Spring storms dropped at least two inches of rain across northern Missouri and in a band from eastern South Dakota to central Wisconsin, and produced one to two inches at many other locations across the Plains, Midwest, and upper Great Lakes region. Abnormal dryness (D0) was largely eradicated across the upper Mississippi Valley, while reductions of moderate and severe drought (D1 and D2) were noted in surrounding areas. Improvement was also observed farther south, although a pocket of extreme drought (D3) persisted in an area centered on northwestern Missouri. Meanwhile on the southern Plains, showers and thunderstorms provided only localized relief from otherwise warm, dry, windy conditions, maintaining abnormally dry (D0) conditions. As of April 20, USDA rated Texas' winter wheat crop 31 percent very poor to poor, an increase from 25 percent a week earlier.</p>
   <p>Despite recent topsoil moisture improvements, long-term drought remained a concern on the High Plains. As a result, the amount of rangeland and pastures rated in very poor to poor condition was still significant, according to USDA. On April 20, the percentage of pastures rated very poor to poor included 71 percent in Colorado, 58 percent in New Mexico, 56 percent in Nebraska, 55 percent in South Dakota, 52 percent in Wyoming, and 49 percent in Kansas. Meanwhile, precipitation eased stress on pastureland across the upper Midwest, where the percentage of pastures rated very poor to poor declined from 36 to 25 percent in Iowa and from 43 to 37 percent in Wisconsin. Just to the east, however, only light rain fell across northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, southern Lower Michigan, northern Indiana, and much of Ohio, leading to some slight increases in coverage of abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate to severe drought (D1 to D2).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and Far West">
   <p>Cool, unsettled weather slowed agricultural fieldwork in the West Coast States but provided some additional drought relief farther inland. According to the California Department of Water Resources, the Sierra Nevada snow pack recently gained about 4 inches of water equivalent, climbing from 20 inches (about 70 percent of normal) at the end of March to approximately 24 inches (94 percent of the April 21 normal) three weeks later. Although spring precipitation has been beneficial in moderate to extreme drought areas (D1 to D3) across the Intermountain West, improvements have been noted only in small increments because of significantly below-normal reservoir levels in seven states (Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming) and prospects for below-normal spring and summer runoff in many Western watersheds. Nevertheless, only a small area of exceptional drought (D4) persists, centered on southwestern Wyoming, compared to the broad D4 coverage across parts of eight Western States as recently as late-summer 2002.</p>
