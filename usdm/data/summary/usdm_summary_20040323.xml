  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Following a recent period of tranquil weather, a more active weather pattern is unfolding across the majority of the United States. During the next five days (March 25-29), rain showers and locally severe thunderstorms are expected to become more numerous across the Plains and Midwest. Showers are also likely in the Northeast, although drier air is forecast to arrive during the weekend (March 27-28). The NWS forecasts that at least one-half inch of rain will fall during the five-day period in most areas from Kansas to Minnesota eastward into New England, with some two-inch totals possible in the lower Great Lakes region. Farther south, however, warm, dry weather is expected to persist in the Southeast into early next week. One positive sign is that some computer simulations are forecasting the development of a slow-moving, cut-off low pressure system across the South early next week. If the cut-off low develops, heavy rain may spread from the lower Mississippi Valley into the Southeast early next week. West of the Rockies, a pair of cold fronts will maintain unsettled weather in the Northwest, and may produce precipitation as far south as central California, the Wasatch Range, and the central Rockies. Mostly dry weather will continue in the Southwest.</p>
   <p>The NWS 6- to 10-day outlook for March 30 - April 3 calls for a continuation of above-normal temperatures nearly nationwide. Near- to above-normal precipitation is likely on the Plains from the Dakotas southward into Texas. Drier-than-normal weather is expected in most other areas experiencing drought or abnormal dryness, including New England, the Southeast, and much of the West.</p>

  <region name="Alaska">
   <p>Precipitation was light and spotty in the Alaskan areas of abnormal dryness (D0). Therefore, there were no changes in the depiction, which is most reflective of below-average snow packs and precipitation shortfalls since October 1, 2003.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>A couple of late-season snow storms moved across the Northeast from March 16-19, dropping as much of one inch of liquid equivalent in the abnormally dry (D0) area stretching from east-central New York to the New England coast. During the four-day period, Albany, New York, netted 10.6 inches of snow, including 7.0 inches on March 16. As a result of the moderate precipitation, there was a slight reduction of D0 coverage in east-central New York and southern New England.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Upper Midwest">
   <p>Dry weather prevailed on the Plains for the seven-day period ending March 22, accompanied by temperatures ranging from near normal in eastern portions of Kansas and Nebraska to as much as 10 degrees F above normal on the High Plains. In much of Oklahoma and Texas, pastures and winter wheat continued to benefit from February and early-March rainfall. However, from eastern Colorado and western Kansas northward into Montana, effects of long- and short-term precipitation deficits were becoming more apparent as warmth triggered winter wheat and pastures to break dormancy. Information released by USDAs National Agricultural Statistics Service on March 21 indicated that 60 percent of the winter wheat and 51 percent of the rangeland and pastures in Colorado were rated in very poor to poor condition. Crop conditions were considerably better in Oklahoma (14 percent of the winter wheat and 24 percent of pastures very poor to poor) and Texas (23 and 31 percent, respectively).</p>
   <p>Farther north and east, some light precipitation fell across the upper Midwest. Weekly totals as high as one-half inch (in west-central Wisconsin) were not enough to change the depiction, which reflects abnormal dryness and moderate to severe drought (D0 to D2).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South">
   <p>Abnormal dryness (D0) was introduced in a swath from eastern Alabama to south-central North Carolina. In addition, an already existing area of dryness centered on southeastern Oklahoma was expanded.</p>
   <p>In the Southeast, rainfall deficits have increased dramatically in March, following a general four-month dry spell (October 2003 - January 2004) and a brief February wet spell. At this time, there are few long-term effects due to a wet weather pattern for most of 2003. However, short-term effects include dry topsoils, sharp declines since March 1 in unregulated streamflows, and a recent rash of wildfire activity.</p>
   <p>The USDAs National Agricultural Statistics Service released information for the week ending March 21 highlighting some of the incipient effects of dryness in Georgia. For example, a report from central Georgia indicated that dry weather is slowing the growth of winter grazing. In addition, farmers in west-central Georgia have expressed soil moisture concerns. Nevertheless, dry soils during the spring are often beneficial to agricultural interests, promoting rapid planting.</p>
   <p>Southeastern streamflows plummeted during the first three weeks of March. In Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, the percentage of river gauges reporting flows in the lowest one-tenth of historical values for the date topped 60 percent on March 23, up from 5 percent or less on March 1. For the period October 1, 2003 - March 22, 2004, a nearly six-month stretch, precipitation departures from normal and percent of normal values were as follows: Charlotte, North Carolina, -12.46 inches and 50 percent of normal; Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina, -11.59 inches and 59 percent; and Atlanta, Georgia, -10.10 inches and 65 percent. March 1-22 rainfall totaled less than one-quarter of an inch in many Southeastern locations, including the Georgia cities of Savannah (0.08 inch, or 3 percent of normal), Macon (0.17 inch, or 5 percent), and Columbus (0.20 inch, or 5 percent).</p>
   <p>According to a report released by the National Interagency Fire Center on March 19, there were a number of wildfires burning in or near the abnormally dry (D0) areas in the Southeast and on the southeastern Plains, including eastern Oklahoma. Although most of the 19 large fires (in excess of 100 acres) were contained, they were collectively responsible for charring more than 40,000 acres of vegetation across six states (Oklahoma, Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Mostly dry weather accompanied an early-season heat wave across the West. For the seven-day period ending March 22, temperatures generally ranged from 5 to 10 degrees F above normal in the Northwest. Farther south, however, several locations in California, the Great Basin, and the Southwest reported temperatures in excess of 15 degrees F above normal. Hundreds of daily-record highs were established and several monthly records were set or tied. In Utah, Escalante (80 degrees F on March 22) tied a monthly record that had remained on the books since March 29, 1911. Grand Junction, Colorado (81 degrees F on March 20), tied a monthly record initially established on March 19, 1907, and tied on March 26, 1971.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile in Nevada, Las Vegas noted 90, 92, 91 degrees F from March 20-22, marking its earliest 90-degree heat on record (previously, 91 degrees F on March 31, 1966). In California, temperatures in downtown Sacramento reached or exceeded 80 degrees F on 14 consecutive days (March 8-21), smashing its record of four days most recently attained from March 28-31, 2002. Daily-record highs were set on 13 of those 14 days in downtown Sacramento. In addition, Sacramento shattered its March record for days with highs of 80 degrees F or greater, previously set with eight such days in 2001. Elsewhere in California, Fresno tied a March record with 10 days of 80-degree warmth, previously established in 1972. Meanwhile, Bakersfield, California, noted highs of 92 and 93 degrees F on March 18 and 20, toppling last years record of one March day with 90-degree heat.</p>
   <p>Western pastures and rangeland continued to reflect the effects of long-term drought. Information released by USDAs National Agricultural Statistics Service on March 21 noted that 86 percent of New Mexicos pastures and rangeland were rated in very poor to poor condition, along with 57 percent of Arizonas.</p>
   <p>According to a weekly report issued by the USDAs Natural Resources Conservation Service on March 22, snow water content decreased by 15 to 35 percent in nearly every Western basin except in Washington and the northern Rockies. Decreases were greatest, up to 76 percent, in Arizona and southeastern New Mexico, where most snow packs have now melted out.</p>
   <p>Problems related to premature melting of Western snow packs include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
   <p>1) Many Western river systems are managed based on historical timing and volume of streamflow peaks. In some instances, an early snow-melt season may require special operations to meet environmental, municipal, recreational, and agricultural needs. For basins without reservoirs, premature melting means that streams may crest earlier than normal and recede to summer baseflow levels earlier, leaving less water available during the warm season.</p>
   <p>2) Drought is deeply entrenched across the West, except in the Pacific Coast region. As a result, there is already a natural competition for melting snow between drought-lowered reservoirs and drought-parched soils. In addition, March warmth and winds are causing some of the snow to be lost directly to the atmosphere by sublimation. On top of that, above-normal temperatures are causing trees, grasses, and other vegetation to begin growing at an earlier-than-normal date, promoting an additional drain on already limited soil moisture reserves.</p>
