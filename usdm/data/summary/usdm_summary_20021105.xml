  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 10-day period through November 16 that may affect areas experiencing dryness or drought include: Over the next 5 days (November 7-11): 1) much of the country will enjoy unseasonably warm weather with most areas east of the Rockies expecting to see little in the way of precipitation. An exception to this could be in areas of northern Indiana and Ohio (as well as eastern Michigan) where they may see precipitation totals approaching an inch or more; 2) the big story is that a series of strong systems (loaded with a lot of Pacific moisture) are poised to knock down the door (high pressure ridge in the Pacific) and drench the west coast, Pacific NW, and Intermountain West over the next few days with precipitation totals approaching 4-8 inches or more (liquid equivalent) in the upper elevations of the Sierra Cascades and coastal ranges and 2-4 inches in the interior; 3) above-normal temperatures are expected to continue into the 6-10 day period ending November 16th for California, Nevada and the Pacific NW while the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast can expect to enjoy above-normal temperatures; 4) the Pacific NW can also expect to see the above-normal precipitation pattern continue into this same period as can the entire east coast. The central Plains and the Intermountain West are forecasted to see below-normal precipitation over this 6-10 day time frame.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Conditions on the island of Molokai have been downgraded to moderate hydrological drought (D1 W). Heavier rains in prior weeks have not been enough to offset elevated demands on the water coupled with a recent dry spell. A voluntary 20% reduction in consumption has been put in place for irrigators using the main reservoir.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="New England and Mid-Atlantic">
   <p>New England was cool and dry last week. Rains over the past month have led to the removal of abnormally dry (D0) conditions in southern New England.</p>
   <p>The Mid-Atlantic region experienced a cool and wet week with one inch totals falling across parts of Virginia, West Virginia, New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware. Surprisingly, (during a climatologically dry time of the year) above-normal rains this fall continue to slowly put a dent in the drought that has gripped this region for some time. They have not been enough to ease all water supply fears in the region though, as some drought emergency declarations and water restrictions can be found scattered across the region even though the short-term picture has been one of replenishment. Soil conditions are improving and stream flow and reservoir levels are beginning to rebound as well. Not unexpectedly, groundwater levels have been a little slower to rebound, which is indicative of the long-term drought that has plagued parts of this region for three or more years now.</p>
   <p>As a result, improvement has been reflected on the map as severe hydrological drought (D2 W) has retreated southward out of the New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Washington D.C. areas into south-central and south-western Virginia, leaving most of the region abnormally dry (D0 W) or in moderate hydrological (D1 W) drought. Above-normal rainfall will need to continue over the coming weeks and months in order to overcome larger long-term deficits which resulted in low reservoir and groundwater levels.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southeast, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>The Southeast enjoyed a seasonably warm and dry week with only parts of Tennessee and southwestern Georgia seeing rains amount to over an inch. In Tennessee, the rains of the past 6 weeks (during their normally driest time of the year) have been very much welcomed and have resulted in improvements here as soil moisture and streamflow levels recover slowly but surely. In Georgia and the Carolinas, good rains over the past two months have led to the whittling away of drought and has warranted the removal of the extreme drought (D3) area in North Carolina. Streamflows and soil moisture levels have improved here markedly.</p>
   <p>The situation in Puerto Rico remains unchanged from last week as southern reaches of the island remain abnormally dry (D0). Streamflow levels remain low in various spots on the island.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Ohio Valley and Great Lakes">
   <p>Cool, dry weather also dominated this region the last seven days. Moderate drought (D1) has pressed westward in both Michigan and Indiana while abnormally dry conditions have pushed farther west into Illinois. Soil moisture levels continue to deteriorate in these parts.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and the West">
   <p>As we transition from fall into winter, the agricultural (A) depiction has been removed from most of the West. Much of the interior West is now under a hydrological (W) depiction as most agricultural activity has waned or gone dormant until spring. The Plains and parts of the Pacific Northwest remain in A/W as winter wheat conditions have suffered a bit in places.</p>
   <p>The most notable weather feature last week came in the form of a substantial cold snap, which was felt across most of the West and the Plains. Temperatures fell 10-15 degrees below normal and were accompanied by very little in the way of precipitation outside of modest amounts in parts of Colorado and Nebraska.</p>
   <p>Recent (and longer-term) improvements have led to the removal of severe drought (D2) in the Big Bend area of Texas as well as reductions in the northern panhandle. In Oklahoma, the hydrological (A,W) indicator line has been pushed northward into Missouri as reservoir conditions have improved in recent months.</p>
   <p>Farther west, severe drought (D2 W) has spread north along the Nevada/California border into the Reno and Lake Tahoe areas. Low reservoir levels are being reported all over these parts as they (and much of the West) continue their slow start to the new water year.</p>
   <p>In the Pacific NW, moderate drought (D1) conditions have spread northward into eastern Washington while severe drought (D2) has pushed south and west out of Oregon and Nevada and into extreme northeastern California. Abnormally dry (D0) conditions now encompass all of Washington.</p>
   <p>Topsoil conditions have continued to worsen and the early reports on winter wheat are not good in Oregon with 46% of the crop rated poor or very poor. In California, 40% of the winter wheat is rated as poor-very poor as well. For the January through October period (based on preliminary data from NCDC), Arizona, California and Colorado experienced their driest such period on record. It was the second driest on record for Nevada and the third driest in Oregon and Wyoming.</p>
