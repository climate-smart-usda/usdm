  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Factors which could impact some of the country's dry or drought areas include: 1) Cool and potentially wet weather through the weekend in the central Plains; 2) Declining temperatures and the chance for increasing precipitation along the south Atlantic coast as the weekend and next week progress; 3) Hot and dry weather through most of the Intermountain West for the next week or more; and 4) Hot weather possibly redeveloping in the central Plains next week.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Several windward Hawaiian locations in Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and the Big Island recorded 2 to 4 inches of rain last week. Light rain fell on some leeward areas as well, but these were not enough to substantially alter the long-term drought situation.</p>
   <p>Beneficial rainfall (2 to 5 times the weekly normal) was reported across most of central and western Alaska, ending D0 conditions. Damp weather but lighter precipitation covered south-central and southeastern sections of the state, leaving some D0 conditions in the Tenana Valley and extreme southern areas.</p>
   <p>Moderate rains (generally 1 to 3 inches) fell on northwestern, interior southeastern, and part of northeastern Puerto Rico, but most sites reported little or no precipitation. As a result, D0 expanded to cover the entire island, and pockets of D1 were noted along the north coast and in the southwest, where several locations have accumulated moisture deficits of 10 to 20 inches since April 1.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest">
   <p>Moderate rains (1 to locally 3 inches) fell on some of last week's abnormally dry (D0) areas, but in areas experiencing first-stage (D1) to extreme (D3) drought, only parts of eastern Colorado, western Kansas, and locations near the Nebraska/Iowa border recorded as much rain. As a result, the stubborn area of first-stage drought (D1) to severe drought (D2) remained across western Iowa, much of Nebraska, and adjacent sections of Kansas and Colorado. Extreme drought (D3) persisted in a part of southwestern Nebraska. Most of these areas received near- to above-normal rainfall during the last 30 days, but most 90-day totals were 25 to locally 100 mm below normal through July 17.</p>
   <p>According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Nebraska crops were being affected by the dryness, with 24% of the state's corn, 18% of soybeans, 22% of sorghum, 49% of oats, and 67% of rangelands reported in poor or very poor condition.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>D2 to exceptional drought (D4) conditions generally persisted across the central Gulf Coast and south Atlantic states. Moderate to heavy rains (1 to locally 5 inches) fell on southern Georgia, much of central and northern Florida, and portions of the Carolinas and eastern Tennessee, but average daily highs of 90F to 98F in these regions kept any beneficial impacts to a minimum at best. Farther west, only scattered light and isolated moderate rains were observed from Alabama, central Tennessee, and central Kentucky westward through the lower Mississippi Valley and Texas south of the Panhandle. These areas also endured an exceptionally hot week, with average daily highs exceeding 95F throughout the region, and reaching 100F to 109F in western Alabama, central Mississippi, southern Arkansas, and much of Texas. As a result, D0 conditions expanded northwestward to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers' confluence and toward central Arkansas while D1 to D4 conditions expanded through the upper Southeast.</p>
   <p>The U.S. Geological Survey indicated on July 18 that in the 5 southeasternmost states (SC, GA, AL, MS, and FL), new daily record low streamflows were established at over 40% of measuring sites, and nearly 75% were among the lowest 10% on record for this time of year. In addition, NASS reported a number of deleterious agricultural effects related to the drought. 72% of Alabama peanuts and 24% of Georgia peanuts were in poor or very poor condition on July 17, as were 41% of Alabama cotton, 29% of Georgia cotton, 17% of Texas cotton, and 18% of Louisiana rice. Furthermore, more than half of all pasturelands were rated poor or very poor in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Generally 0.2 to 1.0 inch of rain fell on most of New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, with sections of the east-central and southeastern Rockies recording up to 3 inches for the week. Elsewhere, only a few isolated areas recorded over 0.2 inch. The rains brought improvement to some D0 and D1 areas in the southeastern Rockies and adjacent High Plains, but D0 conditions expanded into substantial portions northeastern Nevada and southern, primarily because of fire danger and parched rangelands resulting from seasonable dryness, heat, low humidity, and dry thunderstorms. NASS indicated that substantial portions of several states' rangelands were in poor or very poor condition, including Arizona (55%), Idaho (26%), Montana (49%), New Mexico (40%), Utah (42%), and Wyoming (35%). In addition, 21% of spring wheat and 30% of barley in Montana were rated poor or very poor.</p>
