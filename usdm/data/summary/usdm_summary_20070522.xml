  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 5 days (May 24-28), another round of active weather is expected across the countrys midsection, with cooler temperatures expected to be associated with the potential for heavy rains in the Plains. The Dakotas and drought regions of Minnesota and Wisconsin could see some beneficial rains out of this. In the West, only Wyoming and Montana look to have a shot at needed precipitation. The rest of the West and most of the Southeast (except for some coastal areas along the Gulf and Atlantic) should see a combination of above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation as well. Not the best of news for either region. On the brighter side, extreme southern Florida (below Lake Okeechobee) may see some good precipitation in this period.</p>
   <p>The 6-10 day outlook (May 29-June 2) is calling for better odds of warmer temperatures across all of the United States except for the southern Plains and Gulf Coast region down into Florida, which are expected to be normal or below normal. Precipitation prospects dont appear good in Alaska, the West, or the Upper Midwest and western Great Lakes regions. The likelihood of above-normal precipitation is better across the southern Plains, Southeast, and East.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Significant changes are noted this week in Hawaii where the recent dry weather has led to a deterioration of this weeks map. Impacts are starting to pop up on the leeward areas of Oahu, Maui, and the Big Island, so these areas have been downgraded to D1(A). Voluntary water conservation notices and poor forage conditions are being reported in these locales. Conditions remain unchanged over Alaska and Puerto Rico this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Upper Midwest">
   <p>Finally, there was a bit of a breather last week, allowing most of the Plains an opportunity to dry out some after some recent heavy soakings. Soil moisture reserves are in great shape heading into the summer. Some late- period thunderstorms did rumble out onto the High Plains Monday (5/21) night and this recent rain, coupled with above-normal wetness at longer periods back to the beginning of the year or back to October of last year, has led to some slight improvement of the D0, D1, and D2 areas found in western North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska.</p>
   <p>The situation in the Midwest and Great Lakes region remains unchanged this week after last weeks deterioration.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic">
   <p>The cooler temperatures last week helped, but essentially all of these two regions were bone dry (except for the southern tip of FL), again with the only significant rains being confined to the southern tip of Florida. This is simply not enough to stave off, or reverse, the persistent drought that is now taking hold on the region as summer approaches. This has led to the slow but steady expansion of D1, D2 and D3 into more of central Tennessee and D1 pushing into southeastern Kentucky. In North Carolina, D1 has spread east to the coast as recent rains havent been enough to overcome the dryness and deficits that now extend back to the start of the year. All of Alabama is now in at least D1 this week and D2/D3 is spreading over more of the Florida Panhandle. Many locales in northern Florida are running precipitation deficits on the year between 8 to 10 inches or more, which is only 40-60% of normal. Fire danger remains very high over most of the region.</p>
   <p>In Georgia, the drought situation continues to worsen quickly as well with all of the state in D2 except for the border counties between Georgia and South Carolina. In addition, D3 has spread across most of the northwestern and southern reaches of the state. Soil moisture reserves are hurting badly at most depths for most areas. According to a drought statement issued by the Georgia State Climate Office this week, all but six counties are in severe or extreme drought and record to near-record low stream flows are being reported all over the state with groundwater levels already falling to levels normally seen in the dry fall season. USDA this week shows 79% of pasture and range land across the state being in poor or very poor condition. The fire danger is very high across the state as well.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>High pressure was the dominant feature in the region last week, leading to warm temperatures and very little in the way of precipitation. Temperatures once again ranged from 6 to 10 degrees above normal on the week for all but the coastal reaches. Hot on the heels of last weeks downturn in Wyomings statewide average snow water equivalent levels, they once again saw a large drop of 16%, leaving them at a dismal 28% of average after being at just 69% of average two weeks ago. In California, the drought continues to encroach on more of coastal California with the advancement northward of D2(A) and D3(A) up into the San Francisco Bay region. Pasture and range conditions are exceptionally bad for this time of year with 96% of the state being reported by USDA as poor or very poor. The onset of the dry season doesnt bode well for recovery in these areas and the potential for fires remains high. The Los Angeles vicinity is still on pace to set a record for their driest rain season.</p>
