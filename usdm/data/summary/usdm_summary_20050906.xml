  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 5-day period (September 8-12) that may affect areas of dryness or drought include: 1) another shot of late season monsoon moisture is expected to fall across western New Mexico and eastern Arizona, while farther west, rains are expected in western and southern Texas, stretching from the Big Bend region down to the Brownsville area; 2) farther north in the Great Plains and Upper Great Lakes region, some good relief could come to parts of northern Iowa, southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, northern Indiana and southern Michigan as well; 3) a relatively stationary Tropical Storm Ophelia will be a major rainmaker if and when she comes on shore. Her strength and track will have a lot say about the improvement that would follow in the Mid-Atlantic region if the track takes it up the Atlantic Seaboard; 4) temperatures for the 5-day period ending September 12 call for well above normal readings across the eastern two-thirds of the U.S., especially over the northern Great Plains. Cooler temperatures should prevail over much of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
   <p>The 6- to 10-day (September 13-17) outlook shows a likelihood of cooler-than-normal temperatures persisting in the West and Pacific Northwest. Above-normal temperatures are expected from the Great Plains eastward all the way to the Atlantic Coast. Precipitation is a mixed bag for the country over this time period with wetter-than-normal conditions called for in the Intermountain West, the Great Plains and the Midwest. Drier-than-normal conditions are more likely across southern Arizona and New Mexico, and across the Northeast.</p>

  <region name="Alaska and Hawaii">
   <p>The abnormal dryness (D0) found across both Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands remains unchanged this week</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The East">
   <p>Katrina continued to leave her mark as she tracked through the Mississippi and Ohio valleys and into the Northeast. Heavy rains were common as totals ranged from 2 to 4 inches or more across parts of western Tennessee, Kentucky, southern Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and western New York. For the time being, this has led to a removal of all moderate drought (D1) in the East and a reduction in the area of abnormal dryness (D0) in the Ohio Valley and parts of western Pennsylvania and western New York. Although the rains of Katrina were very beneficial on the heels of a dry summer, some lingering longer-term deficits remain.</p>
   <p>In southern New England and the Mid-Atlantic, however, another dry and warm week has led to some substantial expansion of abnormally dry (D0) conditions. The rains of last week missed their mark in these parts. As a result, D0 has expanded in southern New England and has now pushed south through eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey and into eastern Virginia and North Carolina, where rainfall deficits over the past 90 days range from 3 to 6 inches below normal (50-70% of normal).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest and the South">
   <p>The break between those who received a lot of rain and those who didnt was quite distinct in the South as Katrina dumped 3 to 6 inches (and more in places) across parts of the lower Mississippi Valley. Most of these rains, however, missed the stubborn drought areas found in Arkansas, Missouri, and northern Illinois. Improvement is noted with a trimming of abnormal dryness and moderate drought (D0 and D1) in eastern Arkansas and northwestern Mississippi.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, conditions have worsened again across parts of Illinois, northern Indiana and the Great Lakes states. A general expansion of all dryness/drought is noted here, including the core areas of severe and extreme drought (D2 and D3) in Illinois, which has now pushed north and east again into more of northeastern Illinois as well as southeastern Wisconsin. The Chicago area is coming off their 3 rd driest summer on record, which followed their 7 th driest spring on record. Rainfall totals for the year now approach or exceed 10 inches (generally around 50% of normal, give or take) for many locales in this D3 core region.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the story is the same across most of Michigan (including the Upper Peninsula) and across northern Wisconsin into northeastern Minnesota, where intense dryness over the past month coupled with dryness over the past 90 days has led to a general expansion of abnormal dryness (D0) across the interior of southern Michigan, and moderate drought (D1) along the coast of Lake Michigan. Moderate to severe drought (D1 to D2) conditions have now engulfed all of the U.P. and have spread into northern Wisconsin and the Duluth area of Minnesota as a result.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>High pressure settled in across the region, bringing settled weather for the most part across the northern Plains states. Precipitation was mostly limited within the dry/drought areas of Nebraska and the Dakotas. In changes of note, a dry summer capped by a very dry past 60 days (25-50% of normal) has led to an expansion of abnormally dry (D0) and moderate drought (D1) conditions along the Missouri River valley within South Dakota from the northwest down into the southeast corner of the state in the Yankton region. This dryness has also been felt across parts of northeastern Nebraska and western Iowa. where abnormal dryness (D0) has regained a foothold.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>As the monsoon season winds down and we near the end of the water year in the West and Southwest, the status quo remains as we head toward a new water year. Late season dryness has led to some concerns in the Pacific Northwest with regard to winter wheat and rangeland conditions and this concern will shift to the High Plains from Montana southward. Some large areas of the High Plains winter wheat belt have been quite dry over the past 60 days and this bears watching as crop establishment begins in earnest.</p>
