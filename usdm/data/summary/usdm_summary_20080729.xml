  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 5 days, (July 31-August 4) much of the eastern portions of the United States are expected to receive precipitation.  Maximal amounts are projected over the upper Midwest, Maine, the Gulf Coast of Florida and the Ohio River valley.  Warm conditions should dominate the country as much of the United States is expected to be above normal.  The warmest temperatures are setting up to be along the Rocky Mountains and eastward across the High Plains. The NWS 6- to 10-day outlook for August 5-9 shows a ridge continuing to build over the central United States with temperatures forecasted to be above normal.  During this time, the central and Mid- Atlantic states may see temperatures well above normal.  Below normal precipitation is expected throughout most of Alaska and the Great Basin, as well as in portions of the southern tier states.  Above normal precipitation over the High Plains and New England is projected at this time.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>D2 was expanded on the Big Island as reports of poor pasture and rangeland conditions have spread to the southern portions of the Island.  Trade wind showers have returned to help stabilize drought conditions along the windward sides.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Puerto Rico and Alaska">
   <p>No changes were made this week to either location.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast">
   <p>With a continued wet pattern, the remaining D0 in the region was improved this week except for southern New Jersey.  There are concerns yet with groundwater and river flows in this part of the state as some of these conditions have not truly recovered from last summer.  Several inches of rain fell through much of New England and the short-term dryness was relieved.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Midwest">
   <p>Some precipitation across the northern Plains did not bring relief from the ongoing drought, and the drought intensity actually worsened this week.  D3 was expanded out of North Dakota and into eastern Montana and was also expanded to the east to include more of north central North Dakota.  Severe agricultural impacts are being reported in this region, with some producers suffering a 75 percent loss of hay this year.  With crops just entering a time of high water usage, the conditions across North Dakota are not looking favorable.  D0 was also expanded to the Minnesota state line in the Red River valley.  In South Dakota, the D0 conditions were improved out of the southeast portion of the state because of recent rainfall events.  D1 was expanded slightly eastward in northeast South Dakota and into Minnesota as this region continues to miss out on precipitation.  In northern Minnesota, D0 was expanded to Lake Superior, encompassing the region where less than 50 percent of normal precipitation has been recorded since mid June.</p>
   <p>Texas saw both intensification and improvement this week.  With the full assessment of tropical storm Dolly available, conditions were improved over the regions that received the most rain from this event.  Improvement was made to the drought intensity in south Texas, expanding the drought-free region northward.  D4 was also improved along the southern/southwestern edge of the exceptional drought region.  In the Big Bend region, a categorical improvement was made where the D3 was eliminated and the D2 was shifted to the south.  D0 was also eliminated in far west Texas and into southern New Mexico as monsoonal moisture along with the remnants of Dolly helped to improve conditions and even brought flooding in this region.  In north central Texas, D2 was introduced and D1 was expanded to the west and east, as this area is close to 7.50 inches below normal precipitation since May 1. D0 was expanded in northeast Texas and D1 was also introduced into the Panhandle region.  D2 was expanded and D3 introduced in the Pecos region, as this area has not benefited from the most recent rains.  Midland Airpark has received only 0.76 inches of precipitation since May 1, which is close to 15 percent of normal for what should be the wettest time of year in this area.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Seasonal rains through the region did not help to improve the long-term problems that are still being observed in the region.  Streamflows and deep soil moisture are lower than they were last year at this time, even with more precipitation being recorded.  D2 was expanded in the northwest and southeast portions of Alabama this week because of continued record or near record low streamflows.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>It was another dry week for most of the western United States.  In Nevada, D1 was expanded east and north in the eastern part of the state to include the far western reaches of Utah.  D2 was also pushed over White Pine County, where hydrological problems exist as well as low soil moisture. In Washington and Oregon, several indicators are showing short-term dryness along the coasts.  At this time, D0 was expanded to include just the southwest part of Oregon, but other areas of both states may be prone to deterioration if conditions continue to decline.</p>
   <p>D2 with an Agriculture designation was added to portions of northern and central California, Based on various indicators, this was needed and due.  Nonirrigated, dryland, and natural vegetations are in very bad shape with no relief in sight in the near term.  Lack of rainfall in early spring has severely impacted pasture growth throughout the state, and 8.7 million acres are showing a loss of 58.7 percent (average for the state) of annual forage for the year so far.  Several counties are showing forage losses: up to 85 percent in Glenn County, 80 percent in Napa County, and 85 percent in Calaveras County. Supplemental feeding is taking place and many producers are selling off animals already because of lack of forage and rising feed costs.</p>
