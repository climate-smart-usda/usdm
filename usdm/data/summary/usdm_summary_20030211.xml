  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>The 5-day outlook (Feb.12-15) shows that the attention has shifted from too dry to too wet as bands of showers will continue to push inland through California and into Arizona over the weekend. While 2-4 inches are expected in southern California, 1-2 inches could also fall across most of Arizona, with some much-needed snow falling in the highest elevations. The rest of the West is expected to see little if any, precipitation. The other region that could benefit from rains is the Southeast, as 1-3 inches are expected from the Florida Panhandle up into North Carolina. The Midwest is expected to remain dry over this period. As for temperatures, all but the upper Great Lakes states and the Northeast should see above-normal temperatures.</p>
   <p>Looking out further, the 6-10-day forecast (Feb. 18-22) shows a weakening in the western ridge, which should allow for a more west-to-east flow (zonal). This means milder weather will be on tap for a good deal of the country as colder Canadian air is kept at bay up north. Above-normal precipitation is expected for the Pacific NW and the Intermountain West during this time period while the central Plains are expected to see below-normal precipitation. As for temperatures, the Pacific NW should be colder than normal, while the Great Plains, Midwest and Southeast should all enjoy unseasonably warm weather.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Most locations on the islands remain dry and continue to fall behind normal for the year and the season. As a result, there are no changes to the abnormally dry (D0) and moderate drought (D1) conditions depicted on this week's map.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Puerto Rico">
   <p>For the third consecutive week, good rains (1-3 inches or more) continued to help out much of the island, leading to a continued whittling away of the abnormally dry (D0) conditions across parts of eastern and northern Puerto Rico. Over the southern and north-central reaches of the island, streamflows remain low.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The East">
   <p>From a recovery perspective, the cold and snow seen in recent months in the Northeast have been welcomed after recent warmer and drier winters. This type (colder/wetter) of winter is much more conducive to recovery in soil moisture, groundwater and streamflow levels.</p>
   <p>In the Southeast, good rains in extreme southern Georgia have been enough to halt irrigation activities there for now, leading to a removal of the agricultural (A) impact designation in this abnormally dry (D0) region. The rains haven't been as good to the north along the coast of Georgia and the Carolinas, leading to a pushing of abnormally dry (D0) conditions to the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and extreme southeast North Carolina. Streamflow levels have been slow to recover and remain low in these areas.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes">
   <p>Most of the region experienced a typical cold and dry week. The western Plains have enjoyed a more active storm track in recent weeks but not enough to reverse their fortunes. Climatologically, we are in the driest time of the year for many parts of this region. As a result, drought conditions for the region remain unchanged this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and Far West">
   <p>After a few promising weeks on the precipitation front, most of the West was left high and dry last week, with cold weather the story in the Intermountain West and the Central Rockies.</p>
   <p>With four months of the water year (October 1-present) in the books, snow water content (SWE) and snowpack levels are generally very low across the Pacific Northwest (25-65% of normal). Abnormally dry (D0) conditions have spread westward over the entire state of Washington and moderate drought (D1) and severe drought (D2) have pushed farther west into central Oregon as well. In addition, continued decreases in snowpack and snow water equivalent totals in the south central basins of Utah have led to the removal of the severe drought (D2) designation there. All of Utah is now shown in extreme drought (D3). The rest of the region remains unchanged from last week.</p>
