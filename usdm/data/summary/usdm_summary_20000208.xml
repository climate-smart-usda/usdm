  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>With storm systems forecast to track west to east near the 40oN latitude during February 9-14, only light amounts (0.1 to 0.5 inches) are expected across the extreme northern portions of this area, while little or no precipitation is predicted elsewhere. Unfortunately, the February 15-19 outlook continues the pattern of dry weather in the southern Plains and below normal precipitation in the Delta and Southeast, along with above normal temperatures.</p>
   <p>As previously mentioned, a favorable storm track for widespread and significant precipitation is anticipated for the central Plains, Corn Belt, and central Appalachians for the next 5 days. Between 0.5 to 1 inch is forecast for the central Great Plains and western Corn Belt, and 1 to 2 inches across the eastern Ohio Valley and central Appalachians. Lighter totals (0.2 to 0.4 inches) are indicated for the northern Plains, upper Midwest, and Great Lakes region. The ensuing 5 days (February 15-19) are projected to be near normal.</p>
   <p>During February 9-14, a series of Pacific storms should move into north-central California, providing heavy rains (3 to 6 inches) to coastal and valley locations and additional heavy snows (several feet) in the Sierra Nevada. Moderate totals (1 to 3 inches) are expected in higher elevations of the Great Basin and central Rockies. Amounts, however, should quickly diminish further south, with only 0.1 to 0.3 inches forecast for southern California, northern Arizona, and northwestern New Mexico, and no precipitation in the remaining area. A similar pattern is predicted for the next 5 days (February 15-19), with surplus precipitation for California, Nevada, and western Utah, normal for eastern Utah and northwestern Colorado, and none for Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Colorado.</p>
   <p>High pressure is forecast to keep the Islands relatively cool and dry during the following 5 days. More seasonable conditions are expected by mid-February as the rainy season normally continues into April.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Showers dampened most of Oahu and the eastern Big Island during January 31-February 1, but little or no rain and below-normal temperatures were observed across the remainder of the Hawaiian Islands, keeping D1 conditions unchanged across western sections of the Big Island, most of Molokai and Lanai, and all but extreme northeastern Maui.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Midwest, and Central Appalachians">
   <p>Except for moderate snows (5 to 10 inches) in the central Appalachians (0.3 to 0.6 inches liquid equivalent), the rest of the region observed little or no precipitation. In Michigan and the Ohio Valley, snowfall was widely scattered and light (0.1 to 0.3 inches liquid equivalent), while the upper Midwest, northern and central Plains were mostly dry. Drought conditions remain unchanged this week, except for the D2 area in Indiana which was shifted eastward into northwestern Ohio where several indicators depicted this region as severely dry. The moderate snow in the central Appalachians did little to dent the 30- and 90-day deficits, and the D1 areas in the Midwest and Plains were recently increased. D1 and D2 areas may be expanded in the near-future if dryness persists into the normally wetter spring months.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and Western States">
   <p>Another in a series of Pacific storms battered the West Coast, with 2 to 5 inches of rain falling on northern and central California, and several feet of snow on the Sierra Nevada. Lighter totals (0.2 to 0.5 inches) were observed in southern California and across higher elevations in northwestern and northeastern Nevada, northeastern Arizona, and parts of Utah and Colorado. With continuing light to moderate precipitation the past 3 weeks in higher elevations of southwestern Utah (between 60-65% normal seasonal precipitation and basin snow water content), west-central Colorado (around 60% normal seasonal precipitation and basin snow water content), and along the upper southern California coast, D0 is receded southward from these three regions. The wet season (November-March) has yet to become established across the Southwest (e.g. a record 0.01" of rain at Phoenix, AZ October 1- January 31), but hydrological conditions are adequate, and 2-3 months still remain in the wet season.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South-Central and Southeastern States">
   <p>Tranquil weather returned to most Southeastern locations, with little or no precipitation recorded from eastern Texas and Arkansas eastward to northwestern Georgia and central Tennessee. Early in the week, a developing storm system off the South Carolina coast dropped light to moderate rain (0.5 to 1 inch) on parts of northern and central Florida and eastern Georgia, and mixed precipitation in the southern Appalachians. Farther west, a weak storm system moved out of the central Rockies into the southern Plains, bringing welcome precipitation to parts of central New Mexico, eastern Oklahoma, and the southern half of Texas. The greatest amounts (between 0.5 and 1.5 inches) were measured in south-central Texas, with lesser totals (0.3 to 0.6 inches) in eastern Oklahoma and under 0.3 inches in New Mexico. Most of these areas had missed the previous week's significant precipitation. With the return to drier weather in eastern areas, improvement of drought conditions stalled, while precipitation in western portions halted further deterioration of moisture conditions; however, 90-day deficits (7 to 10 inches), large CPC soil moisture anomalies, negative 6-month (Aug-Jan) SPI values, and information from Southern Region WSFOs expanded D2 conditions into northern Mississippi and southwestern Tennessee, and D1 increased northward in southeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee, and westward into the Florida Panhandle. The D1 area was decreased in northern Alabama as the Birmingham WSFO reported that moisture conditions in most of the state were near normal.</p>
