  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 5 days (June 4-8) temperatures are expected to be below normal over most of the United States.  High temperatures will be 12 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit below normal over the northern Plains and up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in the Southwest.  Temperatures in Texas are expected to range 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.  A widespread and active precipitation pattern is forecasted over much of the United States with maxima precipitation amounts showing up over the Mid-Atlantic, Florida and the Midwest.  Precipitation looks promising over northern California and Oregon and into Idaho as well. The Climate Prediction Center 6-10 day forecast (June 9-13) shows temperatures continuing to be below normal over the northern half of the United States, with the coolest temperatures expected over the northern Plains, Great Lakes, and New England.  Above-normal temperatures are expected over the Gulf Coast and into Texas.  The coolest areas are also expected to be the wettest, with a good chance for above-normal precipitation from New England and the Mid-Atlantic, through the Midwest and Great Plains and into the Rocky Mountains.  The best chances for drier-than-normal conditions are over south Texas and Alaska during this time frame.</p>

  <region name="Alaska and Hawaii">
   <p>No changes in either state this week.  Conditions in Hawaii continue to deteriorate and expansion of drought severity may be needed in the near term.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Florida">
   <p>The wet season continued to arrive in full force over much of Florida.  All drought was eliminated outside of a small pocket of D0/D1 along the southwest coast that the recent rains have missed.  Several records were broken for May precipitation across southern Florida, including some that had stood for more than 75 years.  For the month of May, Daytona Beach recorded 22.33 inches (685 percent of normal), Sanford 17.00 inches, Ponce Inlet 17.74 inches, and Kissimmee 17.09 inches, compared to just 3.92 inches in Naples and 3.87 inches in Key West.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, and Carolinas">
   <p>D0 was expanded to include all of northern New Jersey and into extreme southeastern New York.  D0 was eliminated from western New York and all of western Pennsylvania this week.  The region has recorded several rain events over the last few weeks that have been enough to remove the abnormally dry (D0) conditions from the region.  There is still a pocket of dryness in the Buffalo, New York, area that will need to be watched if the recent rains do not persist. In the Carolinas, the D0 in eastern North Carolina was expanded to the west as hydrological impacts are still persisting even with the recent rains.  Along the North and South Carolina border, the D0 was reduced and split from a separate pocket of D0 in extreme northeast Georgia.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>May was dry over much of the Plains region.  Locally heavy rains did take place at the end of Drought Monitor period over southwest Nebraska, southeast Nebraska and northeast Kansas.  Many locations are 5 to 6 inches below normal for the calendar year and only cool temperatures have kept crop stress to a minimum at this point.  Most locations started this agricultural season with a full soil moisture profile, but topsoils are being depleted rapidly and some areas are already seeing stress on emerging crops and smaller heads filling in on the wheat crop.  D0 was expanded into most of eastern Nebraska, western Iowa and South Dakota.  An area of D0 was also extended south out of South Dakota and into western Nebraska.  At the end of the current Drought Monitor period, slow-moving showers were pushing through many of the newly added D0 areas in South Dakota.  These rains may improve conditions enough to eliminate portions of the D0 in the next week.  D0 was also added into extreme northwest North Dakota this week.  As temperatures continue to warm and water demand increases, this area is ripe for moderate drought in the near future.</p>
   <p>D0 was also expanded this week in Oklahoma as the northern portions of the state have not received normal precipitation during the peak precipitation period for them.  In Texas, improvements were made in the central portion of the state, expanding the drought-free region and overall showing a categorical improvement to the region.  In south Texas, a categorical improvement was made along the D2/D3 regions, while D3/D4 were improved along Matagorda Bay in response to the recent rains.  Improvements were also made in north-central Texas, where D0/D1/D2 regions were shifted to the west.  In west Texas, D1 and D2 were improved in response to good rains over the last few weeks.  D3 and D4 were expanded near Austin because after some improvements in this region, the area is showing deterioration again.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>D0 was improved slightly in north-central Arizona in response to recent rains in the region.  D0 was added to several locations in Montana in response to abnormally dry conditions for the current agricultural season.  A reassessment of conditions in California going into the dry season led to the expansion of D2 down along the southern coast of the state.  In Oregon, D2 was expanded into the southern portion of the state as several indicators were showing this region to be worse than was currently being depicted.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Upper Midwest">
   <p>For the most part, the drought regions of Minnesota and Wisconsin were missed by any significant rains this week.  The southern edge of the drought in Wisconsin did record  up to 3  inches of rain, which led to improvements to the D0/D1 regions along the southern edge of the drought.  D1 and D2 were expanded around the Twin Cities, while D0 was expanded in southwest Minnesota.</p>
