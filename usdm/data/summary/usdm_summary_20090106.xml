  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 5 days (January 7-11) a potent storm system will continue to  move over the eastern United States, bringing with it widespread precipitation  from the Southeast up into New England.  Another system will also come ashore in  the Pacific Northwest, bringing widespread precipitation through the region and  into the northern Rocky Mountains.  Temperatures during this time will be above  normal for most of the United States outside of upper New England.  Temperatures  are expected to be 6-9 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over much of the West and  Plains and 3 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in the Southeast.  Temperatures in  the Great Lakes and New England should be 3-9 degrees Fahrenheit below normal.  The National Weather Service 6- to 10-day outlook for January 12-16 continues  with the best chances for colder than normal temperatures over the eastern half  of the country as a large trough settles in over the region.  A ridge over the  west will likely allow temperatures to warm up, with temperatures from Alaska  through Arizona to be above normal.  Dry conditions will dominate the western  and central United States under the ridge, while there are good chances for  above-normal precipitation in Alaska, the northern Plains, the Great Lakes, and  portions of Florida.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Recent precipitation has allowed for some improvements over Hawaii this week.  In central Maui, D3 was improved to D2 while D0 over east Maui was improved as  well.  On the east side of the Big Island, a categorical improvement was made  this week, and a slight improvement to the D2 and D3 conditions along the  northeast slopes.  On Oahu, the area that was D0 was changed to D1 due to  continued water restrictions on irrigation water use at the Waimanalo Reservoir.  December rainfall helped to improve reservoir levels, but irrigation water  restrictions are still in place.</p>

  <region name="The Midwest">
   <p>Short-term conditions continue to improve over the region, with many areas at  or slightly above normal over the last several months for precipitation totals.  D2 was removed from Kentucky and D1 was slightly improved in West Virginia and  Ohio.  Longer-term issues still exist in the region, and additional  precipitation will be needed to continue improvements.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Another dry week over the Plains and dryness over the last few months has  started to impact the region.  D0 was expanded over west Texas and into  southeast New Mexico.  Lubbock, Texas, recorded just 0.01 inches of  precipitation in December, which followed only 0.08 inches in November for a  total of 1.29 inches below normal for those two months.  Several days in  December, Lubbock reported blowing dust with the most intense days being  December 8th and 14th.  Crops are being impacted in Texas with winter wheat and  oats being the main concern.  The condition of winter wheat in Texas continues  to decline with 46 percent rated poor to very poor while oats are 74 percent  poor to very poor.</p>

  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>With La Nina conditions continuing to develop and projected to be in place  through the first part of 2009, the drought situation in Florida is expected to  follow a La Nina pattern with warm and dry conditions throughout winter and into  spring.  D0 was expanded to include all of south Florida while D1 was expanded  to the east.  The drought designation was changed from H (hydrological) to AH  (agricultural/hydrological) to show both short- and long-term concerns.  D1 was  introduced into southern Louisiana this week and D0 was expanded as well.  Several indicators are showing the dryness and precipitation deficits over the  last three months at 8-10 inches below normal.  In extreme northeast Georgia, D3  was pushed south in response to recent rains.  Reservoir levels in Georgia are  still a concern.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>With a continuing active weather pattern, some areas of the region were  improved while others showed some worsening.  D0 was improved in western Oregon  and extreme northern California and eastern Washington where recent increases in  precipitation and snow have been recorded.  D0 was expanded into central and  north-central Washington as this region has not had the good snows that other  regions in the area have received.  In southern California, the D2 in the desert  regions around Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties was improved slightly as  the short-term rains in the last 90 days have been in the 200-300 percent of  normal range.  Long-term issues here, where precipitation deficits over the last  2-3 years are approaching 20 inches below normal, discouraged further  improvements at this time. D0 was improved in southwest Colorado into northwest  New Mexico, refining improvements made last week in response to the very good  snowpack in this area.</p>
