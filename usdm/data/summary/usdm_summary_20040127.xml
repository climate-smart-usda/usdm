  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Conditions expected over the next 2 weeks that could influence ongoing dry areas include: 1) a storm system that will zip through the Pacific NW and into the northern Rockies during the last days of January. This should bring good precipitation amounts (potential for 1-4 inches of liquid equivalent or more) for areas in northern Idaho, the Bitterroot range in Montana and the Teton range along the Idaho and Wyoming border. The same system could drop more moisture along the Colorado front range (0.5 liquid equivalent) and then again in parts of northern Missouri and southeastern Iowa (up to 1 inch liquid equivalent); 2) unfortunately, the real story remains centered around the Big Chill with frigid Arctic air (-10 to -20 degree departures expected for both highs and mins) looking to remain entrenched across the northern and central Rockies eastward through the Plains and into the Great Lakes region well into next month; 3) after that its looking high and dry(and cold) as High pressure will build in and dominate the weather picture during the early part of February. Below-normal temperatures are expected over all but the coastal West and Atlantic coastal states. Above-normal precipitation is possible in the 6-10 day period (2/3-2/7) for the Pacific NW, the Intermountain West and parts of the Great Basin and also for eastern Texas, northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas; 4) early model runs show the potential for above-normal precipitation in the Pacific NW, the central and southern Plains, and the Great Lakes region during the 8-14 day time frame (2/5-2/11). Below-normal temperatures are expected over the central and southern Plains, the central and southern Rockies, the Desert Southwest and the Intermountain West during this same period.</p>

  <region name="Alaska and Hawaii">
   <p>A slow and steady improvement over the past couple of months has led to a shrinking of the abnormally dry (D0) depiction along the Kona Coast region of the Big Island. Although agricultural concerns have eased (leading to the removal of the A impact designation) on Molokai, lingering water supply issues have left the island in D0 H.</p>
   <p>Another relatively quiet week was felt in the Chena and Tanana region within Alaskas interior leading to no change in the abnormally dry (D0) conditions depicted here. Low snow water equivalent (SWE) measurements continue to plague many basins in this region.</p>

  <region name="The Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes Region">
   <p>A major winter storm plowed through the region over the weekend dropping over a foot of snow in parts of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. Storm totals this large are hard to ignore as being beneficial even for this time of year. The storm brought with it much needed moisture (.50 to 1.00 or more liquid equivalent) resulting in a one category improvement depiction within its path. The situation remains mostly the same in the Great Lakes region although the Duluth, MN area benefitted from a nice lake effect storm that dumped over 2 feet of snow in some areas. Improvement was noted in this vicinity as moderate drought (D1) was reduced to abnormally dry (D0).</p>
   <p>Farther south, generous precipitation fell over parts of extreme southwestern Oklahoma, extreme eastern Texas and most of southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana. This short term boost has led to some improvement, most notably in Arkansas, by way of a reduction in intensity and areal coverage for abnormally dry (D0) and moderate drought (D1) in this three corners region. It is important to note, however, that long-term deficits still remain. The lack of precipitation still remains a concern in the western fringes of the Great Plains, from North Dakota all the way down to the Texas Panhandle, thus no improvements are shown.</p>

  <region name="The Rockies and Far West">
   <p>Parts of southern and central Arizona welcomed a good soaking last week as many stations reported anywhere from .5 to 1 inch or more. This has led to a reduction in moderate drought (D1) in southern Arizona, but abnormally dry (D0) conditions remain here as water year (Oct. 1-present) totals are still below-normal. Unfortunately, the situation in northern and extreme eastern Arizona remains dry for virtually any time frame you want to look at. As a result, the drought depiction remains unchanged in these parts and could intensify soon if the wet season keeps failing to deliver.</p>
   <p>In northern Idaho, the trend of good precipitation continued last week, building on a good monthly and water year-to-date totals. Most basins are at or above normal with regards to snow water equivalent. Moderate drought (D1 H) has been pushed slightly south and east out of the Idaho Panhandle and over into the Bitterroot Range of Montana. After several years of drought, however, it isnt time to write off the hydrological drought that has depleted soil moisture, ground water, stream levels and reservoirs. They will need to see a strong finish to this snow season to see any gain on the multi-year drought. The rest of the West (except for the coastal areas of the Pacific NW) saw a pretty quiet week overall, leaving them in status quo mode.</p>
