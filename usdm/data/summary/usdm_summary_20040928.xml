  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 5 days (September 30 - October 4), a pair of strong cold fronts will surge southeastward across the Plains and Midwest. Locally heavy showers will precede and accompany the first front, which is forecast to reach the northern Plains on October 1 and sweep to the Atlantic Seaboard during the weekend. Cold air trailing the fronts, while not a drought-related concern, may threaten immature corn and soybeans from the eastern Dakotas eastward into Michigan. Meanwhile, occasional snow showers are expected in the northern and central Rockies. Farther west, a slow-moving disturbance will continue to spark showers and thunderstorms in the Four Corners States. The disturbance is forecast to drift eastward and may interact with the tail of the first cold front across areas from the southern Rockies to the Delta. The NWS 6- to 10-day outlook for October 5-9 calls for near- to below-normal precipitation nearly nationwide. Above-normal rainfall will be confined to the Atlantic Coast States. Temperatures are forecast to rebound to above-normal levels across the nations northern tier, but near- to below-normal readings will prevail elsewhere.</p>

  <region name="Alaska">
   <p>Cool, showery September weather continued across much of Alaska in the wake of a summer of record-setting wildfire activity and warmth. The coverage of abnormal dryness (D0) was reduced to a core area of lingering, long-term precipitation deficits across east-central Alaska.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Only light showers fell across Hawaiis eastern islands, where abnormal dryness (D0) continued across northern and eastern portions of the Big Island and southern Maui.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest">
   <p>Short-term dryness (D0A) also expanded in parts of the Midwest, including eastern Iowa, northern Illinois, roughly the southeastern half of Wisconsin, and much of Michigan. In addition, an area of moderate drought (D1) was introduced in northeastern Wisconsin. Thirty-three percent of Michigans pastureland was in very poor to poor condition on September 29, up from 25% the previous week. Muskegon, Michigan, netted rainfall totaling 0.09 inch on September 28 to boost its month-to-date sum to 0.22 inch (7 percent of normal) and avert its driest September on record (0.17 inch in 1979). Although the Midwestern dryness was a concern for pastures and late-maturing summer crops, producers took advantage of the conditions during the week ending September 26 to harvest at least 15% of their soybean acreage in Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, and Ohio, and at least 15% of their corn acreage in Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>A band of heavy rain, totaling 2 inches or more in many locations, stretched from eastern New Mexico and western Texas northeastward into eastern South Dakota. The rain eased or eliminated agricultural dryness on the central Plains and brought some slight improvement in areas with hydrological dryness (D0) and moderate to extreme drought (D1 to D3). Agricultural and hydrological impact lines were modified across the northern half of the High Plains to reflect recent rainfall and its effects on pastures and emerging winter wheat.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South">
   <p>The remnants of Hurricane Ivan executed a clockwise loop across the western Atlantic Ocean, southern Florida, and the northern Gulf of Mexico before regaining tropical-storm status and making landfall in southwestern Louisiana on September 23. Some 2- to 4-inch rainfall totals resulted in a slight reduction in coverage of short-term dryness (D0A) across southwestern Louisiana and easternmost Texas. The percentage of Louisianas pastures rated in very poor to poor condition improved from 37 to 31% during the week ending September 19, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Farther north, little or no rain fell from the Mississippi Delta and Missouri Bootheel westward across much of Arkansas and southern Missouri, resulting in a broad expansion of abnormally dry conditions. Pasture conditions in Arkansas deteriorated from 8% very poor to poor on September 5 to 42% on September 26. North Little Rock, Arkansas, on track for its third-driest September on record behind 0.27 inch in 1917 and 0.28 inch in 1956, netted just 0.33 inch of rain during the first 28 days of the month.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Significant precipitation during the 7-day monitoring period was confined to the central Rockies, where some high-elevation locations measured more than a half-foot of snow. There were some minor reductions in the coverage of abnormal dryness (D0) and moderate drought (D1) in north-central Colorado, but the drought depiction was largely unchanged elsewhere. In central Arizona, drought-lowered reservoirs continued to benefit from runoff in the wake of last weeks heavy rainfall. In the 10-day period following Arizonas rain, inflow at three key river locationsthe Salt River at Roosevelt, Tonto Creek at Roosevelt, and the Verde River at Tangleaveraged 3037.5 cubic feet per second per day, compared to the September 19-28 daily normal of 461.4 c.f.s. On September 18, the Salt River reservoir system held 802 thousand acre-feet of water, while the Verde River system held 124 thousand acre-feet. Eleven days later, the storage figures stood at 808 and 140 thousand acre-feet, respectively.</p>
