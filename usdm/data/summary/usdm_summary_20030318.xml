  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During the period March 20-24, a slow moving storm system along the East coast will bring locally heavy rainfall early in the period. Lighter precipitation is expected across drought-plagued areas of the Corn Belt eastward into the Great Lakes region. Heavy rain and mountain snow will affect the Pacific Northwest as a strong and active onshore flow continues. Cooler than normal temperatures are expected over the southern Plains and southern Rockies and warmer than normal temperatures are favored across most of the rest of the country.</p>
   <p>For the ensuing 5 days (March 25-29), a parade of frontal systems will bring above normal precipitation to the Pacific Northwest, eastward into the northern High Plains, the northern Great Basin, and along the Eastern Seaboard southward into the Gulf Coast region. Below normal precipitation is expected in southern California and Arizona, extending to the southern Great Plains, the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes region. Above normal temperatures are expected across the northeastern and southwestern corners of the country. Below normal temperatures are favored for the northern High Plains and much of the Gulf Coast region.</p>

  <region name="Alaska">
   <p>The week started out colder than average at many of the primary stations in the southern half of the state, with temperatures rebounding near the end of the period. An inch or more of precipitation fell at several stations in the Alaska panhandle and Kodiak Island, but a tenth of an inch or less was reported at the primary stations to the north. The week continued a dry trend for the month at stations like King Salmon, Fairbanks, and Anchorage, following a dry winter at stations in the southeast (along the Tanana valley). March 1 snowpack continued significantly below average across the southern half of the state. As a result, the area of D0 in southwest Alaska was expanded eastward to reflect these short term and hydrological long term dry conditions.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>This was a dry week across most of the drought areas with many stations reporting little or no rainfall. Improving reservoir levels over western Molokai due to rains over the past month prompted the upgrade of D1H to D0H.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Puerto Rico">
   <p>This week seemed like a repeat of last week. Little or no rain kept last week's D0AH conditions intact. Below-normal totals for the last 4 or more weeks and continued reports of near-record-low streamflows for this time of year led to the expansion of D0AH conditions to the northeastern coast.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast and New England">
   <p>Precipitation amounts were generally less than half an inch, with only a couple tenths reported across much of the New England drought areas. Low streamflows and below-normal precipitation, modeled soil moisture, and Palmer Index percentiles prompted the expansion of D0 into the northern counties of New York. However, a substantial snow cover remained over much of this area, so no other changes were made.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes">
   <p>Half an inch of rain fell over parts of the Texas Trans Pecos drought area during the week, equating to several times the weekly normal. However, this is the dry season for this area and the rainfall amounts were not enough to affect the longer-term deficits, so the D0 here was left in place.</p>
   <p>An inch or more of precipitation fell across parts of central Missouri, resulting in contraction of the D0 and D1 boundaries. But only a few tenths of an inch or less were reported across most of the rest of the drought areas in this region, so dryness and drought designations were unchanged, with the following exception.</p>
   <p>D1 was expanded across most of last week's D0 area from South Dakota to Michigan due to record or near-record low precipitation over the last 3 to 4 months. This drought has had substantial economic impact on the winter recreation industry in the region, and significant impact on barge transportation on the Mississippi River. Two spots of D0AH were left in place. The first spot was centered over southeastern South Dakota, where modeled soil moisture indicated above-normal moisture at 6-foot depths. The other spot was around west central Wisconsin where a half to one inch of precipitation fell this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and Far West">
   <p>A series of Pacific storms brought abundant moisture to the west coast and much of the Pacific Northwest this week. One to three inch precipitation amounts were common along the coastal ranges with 6 inches or more reported in some places. An inch or more fell in the northern Rockies of Idaho and Montana, but amounts were generally less than an inch in most other areas of the West.</p>
   <p>Last week's drought classifications were changed in areas that received heavy precipitation that was significantly above normal. D0H conditions were erased across Washington, northern Idaho, and extreme northwest Montana. In southern California and southwest Arizona, D3, D2, and D0 were contracted, but D1 was left in place to reflect deficient groundwater levels.</p>
   <p>Across the remainder of the West, although precipitation was many times the weekly normal in some places, precipitation amounts were not sufficient to overcome several years of deficits. Reservoir levels in most states continued well below seasonal norms. Although percent of average season-to-date precipitation increased in some basins, especially across much of the Pacific Northwest, SNOTEL percent of average snow water equivalent decreased in many basins due to warm temperatures and precipitation falling as rain instead of snow. As a result, most of last week's drought classifications were unchanged.</p>
   <p>A major winter storm began to affect the central and northern Rockies at the end of the period. Moisture from this and subsequent systems will be reflected in next week's U.S. Drought Monitor.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>Several stations over the Georgia to Carolinas drought area reported an inch or more of rain this week. However, 24-month to 60-month precipitation deficits were substantial. No change was made to the D0H boundaries in this area, coming on the heels of improvements made last week.</p>
