  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>The circulation pattern during the next two weeks will be dominated by an upper-level ridge over western North America and a trough over the east. This pattern will bring generally warmer than normal temperatures to the western third of the U.S. and colder than normal temperatures to much of the eastern half of the nation. During March 2-7, 2005, the West Coast can expect widespread showers, but generally low amounts of precipitation, ranging from 0.10 inch to 0.25 inch, will bring little relief to the drought areas of the Pacific Northwest. Little, if any, precipitation is expected for the northern Rockies, while the southern Rockies are forecast to receive up to 1 inch during the next monitoring period. The Mid-Atlantic states can expect spotty showers with locally heavier amounts in southern Florida, which could receive as much as 1-2 inches of rainfall.  Below normal precipitation is forecast for March 8-12 over the northwestern quarter of the country, as well as the central Plains to Ohio Valley.  Above normal precipitation is expected from the southern Rockies, along the Gulf Coast, to the southern Atlantic Coast, as well as the northern Plains and Upper Midwest.  Warmer and wetter than normal conditions are forecast for Alaska.</p>

  <region name="Puerto Rico">
   <p>Continued lack of rain during the last seven days prompted the expansion of D0 to cover all of the coast from the northwest to the south central areas of the island. A tenth of an inch to no rainfall was measured over these areas this week, and year-to-date amounts averaged 30 percent of normal or less.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Midwest">
   <p>A quarter of an inch or less of moisture fell across the D0 areas of Minnesota and the central Plains states, with very little to no precipitation occurring elsewhere. The impacts indicators over western Nebraska and southeast Wyoming were changed from H to AH to reflect dryness both in the short term and long term. Extreme southern Texas received half an inch to an inch of rain this week, but 6-month deficits were over 4 inches, or less than 70 percent of normal. Parts of eastern South Dakota have been persistently drier than normal for the last 3 months. These areas will be watched in the coming weeks for possible deterioration.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and The West">
   <p>The precipitation pattern for this week marked a continuation of the pattern that has characterized the Rockies and West for much of the last 4 to 6 months: dry in the north, wet in the south. The Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies states had no precipitation for the first six days of the period. At the end of the monitoring period, a few coastal stations reported up to an inch of rain with a couple tenths of an inch further inland. The cumulative effect of the weather pattern has resulted in record or near-record dryness in some locations. Spokane, Washington (0.04 inch) and Great Falls (0.01 inch) and Miles City (Trace), in Montana, had the driest February on record. Boise, Idaho (0.57 inch) and Great Falls (0.17 inch) and Havre (0.04 inch), Montana, had the driest 2-month period for January-February. Records for some of these stations date back more than 120 years. Record to near-record low 7-day streamflows continued to be observed all along the Oregon and Washington Cascades, and record to near-record low snowpacks were reported along the Cascades, Blue Mountains of northeast Oregon, and Rocky Mountains from Idaho and Montana to Wyoming. Modeled soil moisture indices continued to show deteriorating conditions. As a result, D1 and D2 were expanded in western Washington and D2 was expanded in southwest Oregon. D2 pushed further west across western Idaho into east central Oregon, and D2 pushed eastward into west central Wyoming. Vegetation was extremely stressed in the Bighorn Basin of northern Wyoming, where D3 and D4 were expanded slightly. Riverton, in central Wyoming, received 0.01 inch of moisture during February, ranking as the second driest February on record. Casper, Wyoming, received just 0.13 inch of precipitation, resulting in the driest February on record.</p>
   <p>The impacts line dividing short and long term drought across the West was moved southward to reflect the changing drought timescales across the region. The impacts boundary was moved south to near the state line dividing Nevada-Utah-Colorado on the south and Oregon-Idaho-Wyoming on the north. In some parts of the AH region, including Washington, Oregon, and northern Idaho, conditions have been very dry in the short term (A impacts for last 4 months) and long-term (H impacts over the last 6 years), with wet periods in between. But other areas, such as southern Idaho and much of Montana and Wyoming, have been in continuous drought for most of this period. In some of these areas, less than 70 percent of normal precipitation has fallen over the last 3 years, and less than 80 percent over the last 5 years.</p>
   <p>In the Southwest, another week of rain and snow continued to improve conditions. The last 6 months have been consistently wet -- very wet in places -- with reservoirs in Arizona filling up nicely as some basins received record and near-record water year precipitation. D0, D1 and D2 were pulled back in Arizona and New Mexico, being kept over areas that still have significant long-term precipitation deficits (out to 36 to 60 months). D3 was shrunk to an area in New Mexico around Los Alamos-Las Vegas-Santa Fe, where long-term deficits were still in the 2 to 5 percentile range.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>A couple vigorous cold fronts and low pressure systems moved through the region during this drought monitoring period. A large area received 1 to 2 inches of rain, with some locations getting much more. D0 was split in two over Florida between Lake Okeechobee and Tampa Bay, where 2 to 4 inches of rain fell. The spots of D0 over South Carolina were removed under up to 2 inches of new moisture. In spite of the rain this week, significant deficits persisted across the Southeast  with some areas down 6 to 8 inches over the past 90 days. Some rainfall deficits and percent of normal values for the last 5 months (October-February) include: Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (down 8.34 inches, or 50% of normal), Wilmington, North Carolina (down 8.20 inches, 55%), Lumberton, North Carolina (down 7.58 inches, 55%), Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (down 9.25 inches, 62%), and New Bern, North Carolina (down 7.06 inches, 63%). Palm Beach, Florida, received 2.01 inches of rain during February, which raised their 5-month total to 6.84 inches, ranking as the second driest October-February since 1888. The entire Southeast will continue to be monitored for any signs of deterioration, especially coastal North Carolina, as the growing season approaches.</p>
