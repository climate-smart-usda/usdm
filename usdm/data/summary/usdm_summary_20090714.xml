  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Unsettled weather in the east will contrast with mostly dry conditions across the western U.S.  For the rest of the week, a pair of cold fronts will generate showers and thunderstorms from the Mississippi Valley eastward to the Atlantic Coast.  Some showers are also possible across the southern Plains, although current guidance indicates the rain will not provide widespread drought relief to Texas and Oklahoma.  Out west, high pressure will maintain dry, increasingly hot weather, although monsoon showers will linger in eastern portions of the Four Corners region.</p>
   <p>The CPC 6-10 day forecast (July 21-25) calls for above-normal temperatures in New England and from the Rockies to the Pacific Coast.  In contrast, cooler-than-normal conditions are anticipated from the central Corn Belt south and eastward to the Delta and Southeast.  Above-normal rainfall will be confined to Gulf and Atlantic Coast States as well as eastern portions of the Four Corners Region, while below-normal precipitation continues west of the Rockies and from the southern Plains into the western Great Lakes.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Isolated showers in Hawaii did little to improve drought, with mostly dry weather prevailing over most of the islands.  In keeping with the record heat in the southern contiguous U.S., Molokai’s maximum temperature of 87&#176;F on July 11 was a daily record.   In Puerto Rico, widespread showers (locally more than 2 inches) were reported during the past week, although amounts along the northern coast were generally less than half an inch.  Dry weather prevailed in Alaska, offering no relief to the state’s southern D0 and D1 areas.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southeast">
   <p>Showers developed over much of the region, although unfavorably dry weather lingered across interior portions of southern Georgia.  Nevertheless, there were no new areas of drought introduced into the Southeast during the past week, with showers tallying more than an inch of rain over most of the region.  The most notable change in the Southeast was the removal of D0 from the southern South Carolina-Georgia border, where locally more than three inches of rain fell.  7-Day average streamflows remained in the 30th percentile or lower from Georgia into eastern North Carolina, reflecting the lingering effects of long-term dryness and recent (30-day) rainfall deficits.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Delta">
   <p>Light to moderate showers stemmed the expansion of drought in the southern Delta, although streamflows continued to run at lower-than-normal levels.  Rain bypassed the northern Delta, where D0 was accordingly expanded northward to account for 30-day departures of 2 to 4 inches.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic">
   <p>Below-normal temperatures helped mitigate the impacts of developing short-term dryness in southern portions of the region.  However, pockets of persistent dryness in central North Carolina led to an expansion of D0 (Abnormally dry) into central portions of the state.  In contrast, another week of beneficial rainfall from eastern Pennsylvania northward into New England kept streamflows at near-record high levels.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Drought expanded under a dry, hot weather regime across the south.  In Texas and Oklahoma, record-setting heat (100&#176;F or greater) coupled with gusty winds and little, if any, rainfall resulted in expansion of drought over most areas.  In Texas, drought intensity and coverage expanded over most of the state, with Extreme (D3) to Exceptional (D4) drought extending from Del Rio eastward into Centerville, and southward through College Station to Galveston.  Drought also expanded in western and northern portions of the state in response to scorching heat and strong winds.  The same held true in Oklahoma, where a record-shattering high of 114&#176; in Buffalo was a telltale marker of rapidly increasing dryness and crop stress.  However, more than an inch of rain in eastern portions of the state was enough to keep drought from worsening in these areas, although substantial longer-term deficits still persist.  Farther north, an additional one to three inches of rainfall eased Abnormal Dryness (D0) in the Dakotas, although the moisture was mostly a no-show in eastern North Dakota.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Monsoon showers were mostly confined to southern and eastern portions of the Four Corners Region, offering minimal relief from long-term drought.  Meanwhile, an upper-air disturbance triggered beneficial showers (up to an inch) across northern portions of the region, although rain was largely hit and miss.  A reassessment of the situation in Montana from experts in the field resulted in some modifications to the current drought depiction, with expanding drought noted in western and central portions of the state, while recent heavy rain in northeastern Montana reduced the coverage of D0 and D1.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Upper Midwest">
   <p>Dry weather prevailed, which led to the expansion of drought coverage in this region.  Most notably, portions of northwestern Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota have received less than 70 percent of normal precipitation over the last 365 days, which has caused streamflows to drop below the 5th percentile over large portions of the area.  Abnormal Dryness (D0) was also introduced into northern Michigan, reflecting declining streamflows and pronounced short-term precipitation shortages.</p>
