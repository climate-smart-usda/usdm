  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>The next 5 days (through February 26) are expected to bring moderate to heavy precipitation to some areas currently experiencing dryness and drought, specifically northern California, the Sierra Nevada, the upper and middle Mississippi Valley, the western Great Lakes region, and the Appalachians. Most other D0 through D4 areas should receive light precipitation, except southwestern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Arizona, eastern Montana, part of the western Dakotas, northwestern Nebraska, southwestern Oklahoma, central and western Texas, and the southern Florida Peninsula. Less than 0.1 inch is forecast for these locations.</p>
   <p>The next 5 days (through March 3) should bring wet weather to the Appalachians, Great Lakes region, the northern Plains, most of the Great Basin, and the northern half of California. In contrast, the odds favor subnormal precipitation in Alaska, far southern California, most of Arizona and New Mexico, central and northwestern Texas, and the central Plains.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>In the D0 region of Alaska, no precipitation fell on northern and central sections while light amounts fell on most of the areas southern tier, with a small area of heavy totals southeast of Anchorage. With 90-day precipitation totals now significantly below normal, D0 conditions expanded southwestward through King Salmon. In contrast, D0 conditions were pulled out of Anchorage and areas to the south and east, where precipitation totals have been higher recently compared to areas farther north and west.</p>
   <p>In Hawaii, decent rains (1 to 4 inches) fell on parts of eastern Hawaii Island, eastern Maui, central and southeastern Oahu, and northern Kauai, with only isolated reports exceeding 0.5 inch elsewhere. This kept D0 conditions intact throughout the state.</p>
   <p>Some precipitation finally fell on parts of Puerto Rico, with 1 to locally 3 inches reported across the central tier of the Commonwealth. However, these totals were not sufficient to improve the Drought Monitor depiction, and with another dry week experienced in the southern sections of the Island, D0 expanded westward to cover all of southwestern Puerto Rico, and D1 expanded westward to the boundary of the D0 area depicted last week.</p>

  <region name="The East and Southeast">
   <p>While a winter storm pushed through the Northeast last week, most areas of dryness and drought received relatively light precipitation, with a few areas of moderate precipitation observed. Generally 1 to 2 inches fell on far northeastern West Virginia and adjacent sections of Maryland and northern Virginia, part of north-central Tennessee, and scattered sites across central Georgia, western South Carolina, and central Florida. In contrast, less than 0.5 inch fell on the southern half of the Appalachians and adjacent areas to the south and west, and across both northern and southern portions of the Florida Peninsula.</p>
   <p>As a result, D1AH conditions expanded into southwestern Virginia, southeastern Kentucky, and parts of northern Alabama and Georgia. Meanwhile, abnormal dryness expanded northwestward into northern and west-central Kentucky, and southeasternmost Ohio. Farther south, a relatively dry start to the year has again raised concerns about hydrologic impacts across central Georgia and the Savannah River Valley, with D0H conditions expanding into these regions.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Great Lakes">
   <p>Reported precipitation totals were less than 0.5 inch throughout the D0 to D3 areas stretching from eastern Wyoming and Montana eastward through Michigans Upper Peninsula and southward through Texas, but most areas did receive at least some measurable precipitation. This led to unchanged conditions across a vast majority of these areas, with a few exceptions. Specifically, D4H was removed from near the Rio Grande River Valley, and D1H through D3H conditions upstream were curtailed slightly from the north and west, based on a reassessment of long-term precipitation deficits in these areas and some input reporting less seriously dry conditions just west of the Rio Grande River in Mexico. In addition, steady light to moderate precipitation during the last several weeks induced improvement to D2H in northeastern Wyoming and parts of the adjacent Dakotas and Montana, and conditions improved to D1H in the northern Black Hills and some adjacent areas where precipitation has been heavier for the last several months than in the nearby D2H areas.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West and Rocky Mountains">
   <p>A few locations in western Montana and northern Utah received 2 to 3 inches of precipitation last week while amounts of 1 to 2 inches were scattered to isolated across southwestern Montana, western and northern Wyoming, far southeastern Idaho, north-central Utah, central Arizona, and southwestern California (particularly near San Diego). Light precipitation fell on most other existing areas of dryness and drought, keeping conditions unchanged in most areas, except California and Nevada. Exceptionally low snowpack and subnormal precipitation over the last 5 months led to the expansion of D0 into north-central California with D1A pushing into northwestern Nevada and northeastern California. Snowpack is less than half of normal for mid-February in the Sierra Nevada and the higher elevations of northwestern Nevada. Reservoir levels and water supplies have not yet been impacted by this dryness, but concerns about agricultural and environmental impacts are increasing as conditions persist.</p>
