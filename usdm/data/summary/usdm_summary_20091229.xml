  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <intro>
   <p>The weather pattern during this U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) week (last Tuesday through this Tuesday morning) was dominated by a strong winter storm which produced widespread heavy snow across the Plains to Northeast and locally heavy rain to the south.  New weather systems moved into the southern Plains and West Coast as the USDM week ended.  Most of the precipitation fell outside of the USDM drought areas.</p>
  </intro>
  <forecast>
   <p>During the next 2 weeks (January 5-13, 2010), the weather will be dominated by Pacific storm systems moving across the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies, and northern and central Plains, and by weather systems developing along the Gulf Coast which move to the southern Atlantic coast.  Above-normal precipitation is also forecast for northern New England early in the period (January 5-9).  Drier-than-normal weather is expected over the Southwest U.S. throughout the period.  An area of drier-than-normal weather along most of the Mississippi Valley, Tennessee and Ohio valleys, and Mid-Atlantic States early in the period (January 5-9) will shift northeastward, stretching from the Tennessee Valley and Mid-Atlantic States to the Great Lakes and Northeast later in the period (January 7-13).  Most of Alaska is forecast to be drier than normal during most of the period.</p>
   <p>Temperatures should average above normal during the period along the West Coast into the northern Rockies, while below-normal temperatures dominate most of the country east of the Rockies.  Most of Alaska is expected to be cooler than normal.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>More than 2 inches of rain fell over parts of southeast Puerto Rico, with locally 5-plus inches.  But the rains mostly missed the northeast where the greatest precipitation deficits were evident.  Negative precipitation departures were noted for the month-to-date and longer time scales, and 28-day streamflow levels were still low in spite of the rain.  The eastern edge of the D0 was trimmed back where heavy rains fell, but the bulk of the D0 in northeast Puerto Rico was kept in place over the areas with persistent low streamflow and significant precipitation departures.</p>
   <p>This week was another drier-than-normal week for much of interior Alaska.  Many stations reported below-normal precipitation for the month to date and much of the last 6 months.  In response to the low precipitation … and snowpack in the Koyukuk Basin dropping to 50 percent of average … the D0H in south central Alaska was expanded northward.</p>
   <p>Some rain fell in favored windward locations, but most stations across the Hawaiian Islands reported below-normal precipitation amounts this week.  The USDA December 27 crop report noted that soil moisture was at very short levels for the state throughout the week.  Heavy irrigation of crops was required in many areas.  Irrigation restrictions ranged from a mandatory 20 percent reduction to a voluntary 10 percent reduction in use, depending on county.  No change was made to the USDM depiction.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Great Lakes Region">
   <p>An inch or more of precipitation fell over parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota this week.  But the precipitation largely missed the drought-affected areas of the region, where less than an inch … and in some cases less than half an inch … of precipitation was recorded.  Continued low streamflows and persistent long-term deficits resulted in unchanged drought classification in this region.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Half an inch to an inch of precipitation, associated with a strong winter storm system, fell over the moderate drought (D1) area of western Texas.  This lessened deficits and improved soil moisture, supporting the removal of the D1 and contraction of the D0 in the area.  But the precipitation mostly missed the part of the southern Plains from southwest Kansas, across the Oklahoma panhandle and western Oklahoma, to the northern edge of the Texas panhandle.  A below-normal precipitation pattern for this area extended out to the 60-90-day time scale, and dryness was evident in streamflow and soil moisture indicators.  But the dryness was not unusual for this time of year, which is the normal dry season.  Since no impacts were evident, no change was made here to this week’s USDM depiction, but this area will be monitored closely as the winter progresses.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeast">
   <p>While some rain (a few tenths of an inch) fell over east central Florida this week, hydrological conditions continued to improve.  Groundwater, streamflow, and soil moisture across Highlands, Okeechobee, St. Lucie, and Indian River counties were normal or above normal, and precipitation totals were wetter than normal at the 30-60-day time scale.  Water levels in the three main St. Lucie canals continued to increase, reflecting excessive groundwater conditions from the heavy rains of December 17.  The D0 in east central Florida was pulled back but kept in place to the north to reflect longer-term deficits there.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Precipitation amounts were less than a quarter of an inch across most of the West, well below normal for the week.  Half an inch or more fell across some of the mountains and coasts of California to Washington, but not enough to warrant improvement to the USDM depiction.  An area of D0H was added to southeast Idaho and adjoining southwest Montana and western Wyoming, reflecting the lowest snowpack and greatest precipitation anomalies.  Many mountain stations in this area had snow water content in the driest ten percentile for this time of year, and precipitation so far this water year (October 1 to date) was 50 percent of normal or less at many locations.  While snowpack over Arizona was above normal, precipitation across the state was well-below normal for the water year-to-date as well as for the calendar year-to-date.  Modeled soil moisture was dry, and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports indicated 86 percent of the pasture and range land was in very poor to poor condition as of December 27.</p>
