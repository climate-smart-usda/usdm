  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features during the next 10 days that may affect some of the nations dry or drought areas include: 1) The latest in a series of storm systems will approach the South after mid-week, sparking renewed rainfall in eastern Texas by Thanksgiving Day and across much of the remainder of the region thereafter. A second storm is forecast to closely trail the first across the South; 2) Snow showers are likely during the next several days in the Great Lakes region, including northern Michigan; 3) Milder weather across the northern Rockies and northern Plains may induce some snow melt at lower elevations and allow previously dry soils to absorb much-needed moisture.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii">
   <p>Heavy seasonal rains returned to some windward locations, but long-term moisture deficits persisted in leeward areas of the central and eastern islands. As a result, abnormally dry (D0) and first-stage drought (D1) conditions remained intact from Molokai, Lanai, and western Maui to western portions of the Big Island.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Midwestern, and Great Lakes States">
   <p>Widespread, generally light snow fell across the northern Plains and upper Midwest. Liquid equivalent precipitation approached 1 inch in the upper Mississippi Valley, allowing the removal of a small abnormally dry (D0) area. Meanwhile, widespread precipitation (1 to 2 inches) soaked abnormally dry and first-stage drought areas (D0 to D1) in northern Michigan, bringing some reduction in drought severity and leaving hydrological issues as the only concern. Across the remainder of the Plains and Midwest, a cold, dry pattern brought little change in the overall drought situation, which remains most significant in areas centered on eastern Nebraska and western Iowa (D1 to D2), and northern and central Montana (D1 to D3).</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South">
   <p>Heavy precipitation continued to benefit pastures and winter grains, ease or eliminate the wildfire threat, and dent long-term precipitation deficits. In some areas of the South, however, large rainfall deficits have accumulated since 1998, leaving hydrological drought a major concern in many areas. In particular, an area of severe drought (D2) persists across western Texas, while several areas of severe to extreme drought (D2 to D3) linger in areas from the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern Appalachians and adjacent piedmont areas. Weekly rainfall totaled 2 inches or more from easternmost Texas to Alabama, with slightly lower amounts noted across Georgia and the Carolinas. Four inches or more soaked the central Gulf Coast region, with locally as much as 12 inches measured in southeastern Louisiana. Rainfall largely bypassed Peninsular Florida, however, resulting in further intensification of drought that has reached extreme (D3) proportions in west-central parts of the state.</p>
   <p>A few specifics: Although November 1-20 rainfall in Louisiana reached 9.98 inches in Baton Rouge and 10.58 inches in New Orleans, year-to-date totals remained 19.09 and 19.38 inches below normal, respectively. Meanwhile in western Florida, Pensacolas January 1 - November 20 deficit stood at 21.11 inches, despite more than 4 inches of rain in November. In Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina, precipitation was 0.31 inch above normal during the first 20 days of November, following a 38.48-inch deficit during the previous 30 months (May 1998 - October 2000). Low streamflows continue to represent a good measure of the long-term, hydrological nature of the drought, especially in the southern Appalachians.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>The first 7 weeks of the water year featured significant, dryness- and drought-easing/ending precipitation across the Intermountain West. Particularly heavy precipitation was noted in the Four Corners States. As of November 20, high-elevation snow pack (SNOTEL) data from USDAs automated sensors indicated that season-to-date precipitation in the West was well above normal, except in California, the Northwest, and the northern Rockies. Reservoirs in California and the Northwest remain generally well stocked, however, due to heavy precipitation in previous years. For example, seasonal precipitation in the Sierra Nevada averaged near to above normal for the previous six water years (1994-95 to 1999-2000). In the northern Rockies, however, abnormally dry conditions (D0) remain a concern in many areas.</p>
