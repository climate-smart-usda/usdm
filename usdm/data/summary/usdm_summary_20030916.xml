  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>During September 17 - 21, heavy precipitation (2.0 to 3.5 inches) is expected in much of central and eastern Kansas, and in a swath extending from south-central through north-central Minnesota. Moderate rainfall (0.5 to 2.0 inch) is forecast for northern New England, the western Great Lakes region, the upper Mississippi Valley and adjacent Great Plains, the central Great Plains, and northwesternmost Washington. In contrast, little or no precipitation is anticipated for the Intermountain West, Great Basin, Montana, western Wyoming, the southern High Plains, the Four Corners states (except northern Colorado) and lower Michigan. Light precipitation is expected in the remainder of the contiguous 48 states currently experiencing abnormal dryness or drought. For the ensuing 5 days (September 22 - 26) the odds favor above-normal precipitation in New England and the central and eastern Great Lakes, but below-normal precipitation appears more likely for the entire western half of the contiguous 48 states.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Alaska">
   <p>Little or no precipitation fell on the southeastern quarter of Alaska north of the Panhandle, leaving D0AH conditions intact at Northway and adjacent areas. This region has received only about 40% of normal precipitation for the last 3 months, and 1-year totals are less than 70% of normal at Northway. Thirty-day deficits have developed at most locations in the southeastern quarter of the state, but longer-term precipitation totals outside the D0AH area are near- to above-normal except at Anchorage, where 60% of (nearly 3 inches below) normal has been measured during the last 90 days. In Hawaii, 4 to 8 inches of rain drenched isolated sites in southeastern Oahu and east-central Hawaii Island, but only scattered totals of 0.5 to 1.5 inches were reported elsewhere, leaving dryness and drought conditions unchanged.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="New England">
   <p>Rainfall totaled 0.3 inch or less in far northern New York and southwestern Maine last week, and most other parts of Maine recorded little or none. The combination of persistent of multi-year moisture deficits and 90-day rainfall totals generally 1 to 4 inches below normal led to increased hydrologic dryness and drought in these areas. D0H conditions expanded through central and southern Maine and into far northern New York, and D1H conditions were introduced for a small part of central Maine.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Great Lakes region">
   <p>Moderate to heavy rains substantially reduced dryness and drought severity in much of the region. The largest amounts (5 to 8 inches) fell on parts of central and southwest Oklahoma; central and north-central Kansas; northeastern and interior southeastern Nebraska; adjacent areas of South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota; north-central Missouri and south-central Iowa; east-central Iowa; southern Wisconsin; and northwestern South Dakota. Dryness and drought severity classifications improved by 1 category throughout these areas, with small areas of 2-category improvement in northwestern South Dakota, central and northeastern Kansas, parts of eastern Nebraska, and north-central Missouri. Most other areas received 1 to locally 4 inches of precipitation, which induced spotty 1-category drought classification improvements. However, substantial precipitation evaded several areas, leading to dryness and drought persistence or deterioration. Most of lower Michigan received less than an inch of precipitation, as did northwestern Minnesota, much of North Dakota, eastern Montana, southwestern South Dakota, the central and southern High Plains, and parts of a swath from northeastern Kansas northeastward through southeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. D1AH to D3AH conditions expanded somewhat in many of these areas. It should be noted that although the heavy rains proved beneficial for the areas on which they fell, significantly boosting soil moisture content, the wetness came too late in the summer to markedly benefit summer crops, pastures, and rangelands. Between 30% and 53% of both the corn and soybean crops in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wisconsin were in poor or very poor condition, as were 48% to 85% of pastures and rangelands.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Rockies and Far West">
   <p>Abundant to record-setting rainfall (2 to 5 inches) was reported in much of southwestern Colorado and at a few sites in southeastern Utah, north-central New Mexico, and central through east-central Arizona. Drought conditions in most of these areas improved from D3AH to D2H, with improvement from D4AH to D3AH observed in part of southeasternmost Utah. It should be noted that monsoonal precipitation since early July has varied markedly with location, particularly across Arizona and adjacent locales, and the resultant small-scale variations in drought intensity cannot be accurately depicted on the broad-scaled Drought Monitor map. Farther north, between 2 and 3 times the normal precipitation has fallen on parts of northeastern Nevada during the last few months, reducing D3AH conditions to D2AH, while numerous reports of 0.5 to locally 3.0 inches of rain last week led to improvement from D1A to D0A in a large part of western Washington and northwestern Oregon.Weekly precipitation totals ranged from 0.3 to locally 1.5 inches in most other parts of the Rockies and Far West, with little or none observed in eastern Washington, southwestern Utah, central and southern Nevada, western Arizona, and eastern California.</p>
