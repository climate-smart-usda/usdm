  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Systems predicted to affect the Nations drought areas include: 1) A strong system will come off the Pacific and bring much needed rain and snow up and down the Pacific Coast before pushing further eastward into the Rockies and the Plains by the weekend (1/12, 1/13). Heavy rains of 2-4 inches, or more, are expected up and down the coastal and valley areas of California while the high Sierras should welcome 1 or 2 feet of the white stuff. Parts of the Plains may see anywhere from .25 to .50 inches of precipitation by the end of the weekend (1/14). Northern and western Texas have benefitted from recent (1/10-1/11) rains and more can be expected with this wetter pattern; 2) The jet stream should remain in a mostly zonal (west to east) flow pattern through the weekend bringing with it moderate temperatures and moisture before giving away to ridging high pressure early next week; 3) High pressure continues to dominate the weather picture keeping things mostly dry in Hawaii and Puerto Rico except for an occasional shower to two.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>After a minor rebound late last year, drought conditions have once again worsened across most of Hawaii. Lately, a stubborn ridge of high pressure over the region has been preventing even the usual trade wind showers from frequenting the windward areas. As a result, abnormally dry (D0) conditions have returned to all of the islands. Concerns are heightened as the Big Island (Hawaii County) has a higher dependency on surface water and water catchment systems for public consumption. Molokai has seen its situation worsen with severe drought (D2 A,F) now affecting agriculture on the island. Reservoir levels here are also reaching critical levels.</p>
   <p>In Puerto Rico, abnormal dryness (D0) remains intact across southwestern and north-central areas as isolated shower activity has been the norm. There is a chance for better rains by the end of the weekend (1/14) if they can catch the back end of a frontal boundary coming down from the north. Overall though, the situation probably will not change as the island heads into its typically drier time of the year during February and March.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Mid-Atlantic">
   <p>Conditions have continued to slowly erode over the last 90 days in parts of the western Carolinas and eastern Tennessee where extreme (D3) and severe drought (D2) have expanded. Asheville and Charlotte, NC are both coming off very dry years and arent off to a good start this year. The same is generally true for most of the surrounding areas here.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes Region">
   <p>The situation here is mostly in limbo although a good deal of the region has seen a nice mid-winter thaw over the past few days. This has led to a large reduction of snow cover that has been around going back to November in some places. As was expected, much of this melt has shown how little water content was actually in the snow. The bad news is that the ground is frozen meaning the precious moisture will do little to improve soil moisture conditions in these states. The good news is that most of the melt has run off into streams, rivers and other surface catchments, leading to a modest rise in these water levels. The situation will remain in a wait-and-see mode in most areas until Spring.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South">
   <p>Cool, dry weather dominated the South last week. In an unusual twist, given the cold weather that has been so common here, many parts of Florida have seen their worst start to the fire season since 1981 with over 250 fires reported in the past week, more than twice the normal rate. The frost and frequent freezes has caused a lot of vegetation to die off leading to an over-abundance of fuel for wildfires. In addition, water restrictions are in place in some areas. In general, this winter hasnt provided the above-normal precipitation winter people were hoping for.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>With high pressure so dominant over most of the West the past three months or more, many areas are off to a slow wet-season start. As of January 8, only 4 watersheds in the West are reporting both above average precipitation and snowpack according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Many of these basins have seen 50% or less of their normal snowpack and/or water content to date (Oct.1 - present). Pockets of abnormally dry (D0 W) conditions are now being shown in parts of Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Precipitation out of the first round of storms this past week was meager at best. That said, it was the first rainfall seen in Los Angeles in over two months but most totals only amounted to .50" or less around the state. Better news is on the horizon though (see Looking Ahead below).</p>
