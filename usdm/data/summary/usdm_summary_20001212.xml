  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features through December 22 that may affect the Nations drought areas are: 1) A pair of storm systems (Dec. 13-15 and Dec. 15-17) should impact most of the country east of the Rockies with frozen precipitation in the northern and central sections, and rain to the south and east. Largest 5-day totals are forecasted for the lower Delta, Tennessee and eastern Ohio Valleys, and Appalachians; 2) By early next week, moisture should return to the Pacific Northwest and northern parts of the Rockies and Plains as the storm track shifts northward, bringing more tranquil weather to the remainder of the country; 3) Mostly dry and mild conditions are predicted for western and southern Texas and the southern half of Florida for the next week; 4) In Puerto Rico, no immediate short-term relief is expected as easterly trades produce widely-scattered showers. Climatologically, the winter months are the driest months across the island; 5) In Hawaii, no immediate short-term relief is forecast as trade winds should generate scattered showers across windward locations, with a chance of a few leeward showers during December 13-14.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Locally heavy showers (5 to 11 inches) drenched northern Kauai on December 11-12, light showers (0.5 to 2 inches) fell on the windward sides of the Big Island, Maui, and Oahu, and mostly dry weather prevailed across the leeward sides. The latest November statistics indicated that heavy rains during the first half of the month diminished drought on the leeward side of the Big Island by one category. Elsewhere, however, the remaining areas with non-hydrological dryness/drought did not received adequate November and early December rainfall, keeping topsoil moisture deficient. In Puerto Rico, most of the island received under a half-inch of rain last week as abnormal dryness remained across the north and southwest.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic Region">
   <p>Little or no precipitation (less than 0.2 inches) maintained or slightly increased dryness or drought in the central Appalachians and lower Ohio Valley as many streamflows in eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, and southwestern Virginia dropped into the lower 10th percentile. In western North Carolina, both short and long-term dryness has caused nearly two dozen USGS sites to measure record low streamflow for December 12 as the area of extreme drought (D3) increased.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes Region">
   <p>An early-season snowstorm dumped a wide swath of moderate to heavy snow (over 4 inches) from southeastern Nebraska into lower Michigan. In eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, however, the liquid equivalent was rather low, and with the ground frozen, any drought relief would not be expected until spring thawing. Just to the south, another dry week slightly increased severe drought in northeastern Kansas. Dryness remained intact in both the northern and southern Plains as widely-scattered light snow (and frozen ground) provided no significant relief in Montana, and a precipitation-free week kept long-term drought in southern and western Texas and eastern New Mexico. One to two feet of snow covered the D0-D1(W) region of northern Michigan.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The South">
   <p>For the second consecutive week, mostly dry and cold weather encompassed the region, generally maintaining or slightly increasing the regions dryness. Exceptions to this included light to moderate showers (0.5-1.5 inches) across southern Louisiana and along eastern sections of Georgia and South Carolina, providing some reduction of abnormal dryness in both areas. Along southeastern coastal Florida, isolated but torrential thundershowers dropped nearly 15" of rain on Homestead, while 2 to 5 inches of rain fell from Key West northeastward to West Palm Beach, eliminating abnormal dryness (D0). Just to the north, however, a mostly dry week in central Florida (except for widely-scattered light showers on Monday), plus highs reaching into the lower eighties, slightly expanded the areas drought. NASS reported that 98% and 84% of the states topsoil and subsoil moisture, respectively, was rated short-very short. Lake Okeechobee has dipped to 11.6 feet from its long-term average of 14.8 feet, its second lowest level on record for this time of the year. Water managers in both central and southern Florida are imposing new restrictions or considering adding new ones. In addition, the fourth straight week of subnormal precipitation (25 to 75% of normal, 2 to 3 inch deficits) across the Tennessee Valley decreased both topsoil and subsoil moisture conditions as all of Tennessees 14 reporting streamflow levels dropped below the 25th percentile.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>The boundary between frigid Arctic air to the north and mild Pacific air to the south across the north-central Rockies was the focal point for weak disturbances that dropped light to moderate snows (liquid equivalent of 0.5-2 inches) on parts of the Rockies. However, with October 1-December 12 SNOTEL basin average precipitation and snow water content still under 75% of normal in many northern and central Rockies locations, abnormal dryness persisted. In the Pacific Northwest, the wet season (November-March) remained tranquil as only light (&lt;0.5 inches) to no precipitation was reported in the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, dropping both the 2  month basin average precipitation and snow water content to or below 50% of normal. Similarly in western Washington and Oregon, although large 90-day deficits have accumulated along coastal and at elevated locations and most streamflows have dipped into the lower 10th percentile, long-term (reservoir) supplies are adequate, impacts are negligible (except for subnormal snowpack at ski resorts), and the wet season still has over 3 1/2 months to go. Accordingly, D0 is not depicted in the Pacific Northwest at this time.</p>
