  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <intro>
   <p>Beneficial precipitation again fell on central and northern California and into the Northwest, east of the Cascades. Little to no precipitation fell across in from southern California to the Southeast resulting in intensifying drought particularly in the southern Plains. Storm systems brought beneficial precipitation across parts of the Midwest and into the Northeast.</p>
  </intro>
  <forecast>
   <p>The northern tier states are anticipated to receive the bulk of precipitation during March 12 - March 16, 2009. Much needed precipitation is expected for much of Texas in the upcoming days.  Over an inch of rain is possible in central Texas with lesser amounts falling in the Plains, across the Gulf Coast, and into the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.  Additional, lesser amounts are possible in the Southwest as well as through the Midwest and into the Northeast.  The Northwest may also see some relief.  Much of the upper tier of the country, as well as the Southwest, is expected to see little to no precipitation.</p>
   <p>For the ensuing 5 days (March 17 - 21, 2009), the odds favor cooler-than-normal conditions along the entire country east of the Mississippi River.  Most of the Plains and the West are likely to see normal to above normal temperatures.  Normal to below normal precipitation is likely over most of the country with the exception of the Northwest and the Northeast.  Odds favor dry and cool for Alaska.</p>
  </forecast>
  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Drought conditions remained unchanged across the Hawaiian Islands.  Recent rains in windward locations were significant and will contribute to easing drought conditions if they continue.  Above normal precipitation alleviated abnormal dryness in Alaska. Recent heavy precipitation and ensuing high streamflow eased the abnormal dryness in eastern Puerto Rico.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The East">
   <p>Moderate to locally heavy precipitation (2 inches or more) fell in the Northeast with the heaviest precipitation falling in western New York.  Northern New England also benefited from above normal precipitation while southern New England saw near-normal conditions.</p>
   <p>Rain and snow that fell last week across Alabama and Georgia had no impact on the drought this week.  Long-term drought impacts are still being felt in the area. Well levels have remained at extremely low conditions and streamflow, which pulsed following the storm, continues to subside.  Many locations are already back to well below normal streamflow conditions.  Additionally, the level of Lake Lanier has stabilized following a small pulse from the surface runoff.</p>
   <p>Continued drier-than-average conditions in Florida resulted in expansion of severe drought (D2) in west-central Florida to the east coast and in southern Florida.  Continued drying occurred through south and southeast Florida with increases in the extent of severe drought (D2) there as well.  Additionally, wildfires are being reported in the area.  In southern Florida, Lake Okeechobee continues to fall (12.56 feet on March 8).  If precipitation does not increase, further degradation may be necessary in this area in the coming weeks.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Great Lakes Region">
   <p>Most of the drought-affected areas of the region missed the beneficial precipitation that fell just to their south.  Continued long-term deficits resulted in unchanged drought classification in this region.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Mississippi River Delta">
   <p>A week of much below-average precipitation from Mississippi to the southern Plains led to expansion of abnormally dry conditions and moderate, severe, and extreme drought.</p>
   <p>Abnormal dryness (D0) increased through south-central Mississippi due to increasing short-term precipitation deficits.   In Louisiana, the extent of moderate drought (D1) increased northward from the Gulf Coast.  Mounting deficits in the area are showing up in streamflow and well levels which are beginning to run below to well below normal.</p>
   <p>In Texas, moderate drought conditions (D1) expanded in the east, to the south along the Mexico border, and in the west, running up into New Mexico.  Severe (D2) and extreme (D3) drought both expanded from the core drought area in the south-central part of the state.  According to the US Department of Agriculture, the majority acreage of the state is suffering from short topsoil moisture.  Likewise, most of the wheat, oats, and range and pasture land is in poor to very poor condition.</p>
   <p>In Oklahoma, abnormal dryness expanded slightly northeastward, as did moderate drought (D1).  Severe drought (D2) expanded northward to the Canadian River.  Wildfires are beginning to affect the area but are nowhere near as extreme as the 2005-2006 winter season.</p>
   <p>Abnormal dry conditions (D0) expanded northward again this week through western Kansas and into southern Nebraska in keeping with 30 to 90-day precipitation totals that have been less than 25 to 50% of average.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Heavy precipitation once again fell on central and eastern California and into western Nevada further helping to ameliorate drought in the hardest hit areas of these states. Reports of one to three plus inches of precipitation were common through the area early in this US Drought Monitor period.  Extreme drought (D3) was eliminated.  Severe drought (D2) improved in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Basins, as well as in the Russian, Yuba, and American River watersheds and through much of western Nevada.  Reservoir storage continued to increase on many rivers with Shasta Reservoir in the Sacramento Basin increasing its elevation over 10 feet this week.</p>
   <p>Moderate drought (D1) eased slightly in southern Idaho and northwest Montana but built into northern Cascades of Washington.  Abnormally dry conditions (D0) expanded in eastern Washington.</p>
