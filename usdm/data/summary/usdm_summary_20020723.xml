  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>Weather features to watch in the next 10-day period through August 3 that may affect areas experiencing dryness or drought across the country include: Over the next 5 days (through July 29), periods of rain are likely along and south of a stationary front draped across the Delta and the Southeast. Meanwhile in the Northeast, a few days of dry weather will accompany below-normal temperatures. In contrast, hot weather will return to much of the Plains and Midwest, although scattered showers will help to temper the effects of above-normal temperatures. Mostly dry weather is forecast across the southern Plains, Great Basin, and Pacific Northwest, while monsoon showers are likely to continue in parts of the Southwest. During the 6- to 10-day period from July 30 - August 3, the NWS indicates that above-normal temperatures are likely from the central and southern Plains and the Midwest into the East. Cooler-than-normal conditions will be confined to the West Coast States. Mostly dry weather is forecast across the Northeast and Southwest, but near- to above-normal precipitation is expected elsewhere. The greatest likelihood of above-normal rainfall will be in parts of the northern Rockies, northern Plains, and central Gulf Coast States.</p>

  <region name="Alaska and Hawaii">
   <p>Mostly dry weather brought little change to the abnormally dry (D0) areas in Hawaii (western portions of Oahu and Molokai) and south-central Alaska.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The East">
   <p>A pattern of scattered showers brought beneficial moisture to a few areas, but provided overall disappointing rainfall totals in the East. A smattering of July 16-22 totals higher than two inches were noted in southern Georgia, the coastal Carolinas, and the central and northern Appalachians, but most of the East received less than one inch. Additional rain fell after 8 a.m. EDT on July 23, the cut-off time for this product, and will be evaluated for next weeks release. Some expansion of moderate to extreme drought (D1 to D3) was observed in the northern Mid-Atlantic region, while a broad area of abnormal dryness (D0) was introduced from northern Pennsylvania into much of New England. Through July 23, some Eastern year-to-date precipitation deficits included 9.98 inches in Greenville-Spartanburg, SC, 9.18 inches in Lynchburg, VA, 9.06 inches in New York City, and 8.76 inches in Macon, GA.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Gulf Coast">
   <p>Some agricultural dryness and drought (D0 to D2) lingered in the central Gulf Coast region, while a small area of severe to extreme drought (D2 to D3) persisted in Deep South Texas. Year-to-date rainfall deficits through July 23 included 5.56 inches in Brownsville, TX, 9.28 inches in Shreveport, LA, and 15.02 inches in Meridian, MS.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains and Midwest">
   <p>A difficult week for summer-crop producers led to further expansion of all categories of dryness and drought. Exceptional drought (D4) edged into western Nebraska, while moderate to severe drought (D2 to D3) was noted elsewhere in the state. The increase in the coverage of dryness and drought across much of the Plains and western Corn Belt was fueled by a lack of organized precipitation and July 16-22 temperatures that averaged generally 4 to 10 F above normal. According to information compiled by the High Plains Regional Climate Center, the period from January 1 to July 23 was the driest on record for locations such as Scottsbluff, NE (2.15 inches, or 19% of normal), Pueblo, CO (2.19 inches, or 31%), and Goodland, KS (4.74 inches, or 36%).</p>
   <p>Farther east, more than a month of mostly dry weather depleted topsoil moisture and increased stress on corn and soybeans. Abnormal dryness (D0) expanded across most of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, southern Michigan, and southeastern Wisconsin, while moderate drought (D1) was introduced in southern Michigan and northern portions of Indiana and Ohio. On July 21, topsoil moisture rated 83% very short to short in Ohio, according to USDA/NASS. Topsoil moisture very short to short ratings in other states included 81% in Michigan, 78% in Illinois, 72% in Indiana, and 68% in Wisconsin.</p>

  <region name="The West">
   <p>In the Southwest, monsoon showers reduced the threat of wildfire activity but provided only limited relief from long-term drought. The heaviest showers (locally in excess of 2 inches) fell across east-central and southeastern Arizona and central New Mexico. The net effect on Southwestern drought was the reconfiguration of the wildfire (F) designation and some slight reduction of moderate to exceptional drought (D2 to D4) in the southern part of the Four Corners region. Through July 23, month-to-date rainfall climbed to 1.95 inches (119% of normal) in Flagstaff, AZ, boosting the year-to-date sum to 3.17 inches (28%). Elsewhere in Arizona, Tucson netted 1.77 inches (124% of normal) from July 1-23, accounting for more than 70% of the year-to-date rainfall.</p>
   <p>Scattered showers also fell farther north, especially in northern and western Wyoming, but the West Coast States remained dry. Wildfire activity flared in recent weeks across the Northwest, leaving Oregon with 17 of the nations 41 large fires by July 23, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The current Oregon wildfires are responsible for more than 210,000 acres of burned vegetation, or more than 5% of the national year-to-date total. Year-to-date U.S. wildfire acreage totaled about 3.75 million acres, nearly 210% of the 10-year average for the January 1 - July 23 period.</p>
