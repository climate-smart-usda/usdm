  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>A nearly-stationary upper-air low north of the Great Lakes will usher a series of weak cold fronts across the central and eastern U.S. over the next 7 days.  Consequently, showers and thunderstorms will provide hit-and-miss relief to most drought areas east of the Rockies, with the best chance for heavy rain from the Delta northeastward into the Ohio River Valley and Northeast.  Rain is expected to more or less bypass the Extreme to Exceptional Drought areas of southern Texas, however.  Out west, high pressure will maintain dry, hot weather, although monsoon showers will prevail in eastern portions of the Four Corners region.</p>
   <p>The CPC 6-10 day forecast (July 28 – August 1) calls for near- to below-normal temperatures over most of the contiguous U.S. east of the Rockies, with abnormally warm weather confined to the Pacific Coast States and southern Florida.  Above-normal rainfall is expected in New England and from the central Plains eastward into the Southeast.  Meanwhile, below-normal precipitation will continue west of the Rockies and from northern Montana into the Upper Midwest.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Reports from Hawaii indicated that trade wind rainfall along the east-facing slopes maintained the current status of drought over most of the islands.  Light showers were observed in Alaska, although rain was not heavy enough to offer significant relief to the state’s southern D0 and D1 areas.  Central and eastern portions of Alaska are being monitored for low streamflows as well as increased wildfire activity.  In Puerto Rico, 1 to 3 inches of rain over the eastern and western third of the island maintained near- to above-normal streamflows, while pockets of dry weather were noted in central Puerto Rico.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southeast">
   <p>Showers persisted in Florida and along the Atlantic Coast, while dry conditions prevailed across interior portions of Georgia and South Carolina.  In southern Georgia, D0 was expanded slightly southward due to declining streamflows and 30-day precipitation departures of 2 inches or more.  Abnormally dry conditions (D0) also expanded northward along the Alabama-Mississippi border.  Elsewhere, there were no new areas of drought introduced into the Southeast during the past week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Delta">
   <p>Moderate to heavy showers (1-3 inches, locally more) along the Gulf Coast eased short-term deficits and improved streamflow levels.  Consequently, D1 (Moderate Drought) was removed from southern-most portions of Louisiana.  Likewise in the northern Delta, more than 2 inches of rain eased Abnormally Dry conditions.  Rain bypassed southeastern Mississippi, where Moderate Drought expanded eastward just inland from the coast.  Abnormally dry conditions also expanded into southwestern Arkansas, where rainfall over the past 30 days has been well short of the 4-inch normal.  Nevertheless, much of the southern Delta remains under the grips of longer-term drought, with significant precipitation departures noted over the past 90, 180, and 365 days.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northeast and Mid-Atlantic">
   <p>Drier-than-normal conditions persisted across much of Maryland, Delaware, and northern Virginia, where D0 was introduced in response to declining streamflows and developing topsoil moisture shortages.  Minor expansion of Abnormally Dry (D0) was also noted in central North Carolina, while locally heavy showers in eastern North Carolina resulted in some modest improvement in the D0 areas immediately adjacent to Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds.  Farther north, cool, wet conditions prevailed in New England.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Beneficial rain was observed from Nebraska southward into central and eastern Texas, most notably reducing drought in eastern and southern Oklahoma as well as northern and eastern Texas.  Despite the widespread shower activity, pockets of dryness prevailed in west-central Texas, western Oklahoma, and south-central Nebraska, with minimal - if any – improvement in drought designation.  Scattered showers did little to ease Severe to Exceptional Drought (D2-D4) in southern Texas, where another week of record heat (100&#176;F or greater) compounded the impacts of ongoing dryness.  The latest satellite-derived Vegetation Health Index depicted conditions much worse than the same time last year over southern Texas, indicative of severely stressed crops and pastures.  Farther north, up to an inch of rainfall eased Abnormal Dryness in North Dakotas, although the moisture generally bypassed the Dakotas’ D0 areas.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Monsoon remained mostly confined to southern and eastern portions of the Four Corners Region, although heavy rain fell in eastern New Mexico shortly after the cutoff date for this week’s Drought Monitor.  Meanwhile, additional reassessment of the situation in Montana from experts in the field resulted in some modifications to the current drought depiction, with expanding drought noted in western and central portions of the state.  The remainder of the West was unchanged from last week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Upper Midwest">
   <p>Heavy rain provided drought relief to central and northern Minnesota, with many areas reporting more than 3 inches of rain during the past week.  In contrast, dry weather maintained a firm grip on D0-D2 areas of central and southern Wisconsin, with drought coverage expanded over much of the state in response to near-record low streamflows and large precipitation deficits over both the short and long term.  Abnormal Dryness (D0) also expanded slightly in northern Michigan, a reflection of declining streamflows and pronounced short-term precipitation shortages.</p>
