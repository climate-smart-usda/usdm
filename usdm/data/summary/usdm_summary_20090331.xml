  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>For the next five days (April 2-6), cooler temperatures are expected across most of the United States except for the upper Northeast and the extreme southern reaches of Texas and Florida. As for precipitation, the best chances for significant precipitation in this period seem to be centered over the Pacific Northwest, the central Rockies, and the deep Southeast, with several systems lined up and ready to go.</p>
   <p>The CPC 6- to 10-day forecast (April 7 - April 11) is showing a better chance for the cooler trend to continue across the country's mid-section, with better odds of above-normal temperatures in southern Florida and the chain of islands rimming the Gulf of Alaska. The best chance for above-normal precipitation mirrors the cooler temperatures across the country's mid-section. The areas expected to see below-normal precipitation include northeastern Alaska and the states along the U.S./Canada border from Washington to Wisconsin and Michigan's western Upper Peninsula. This is certainly a bit of good news for those flood-affected folks in the Red River basin in North Dakota and Minnesota.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Recent wetness in the central part of Maui has led to improvement there, but D1 still remains. The rest of the Hawaii remains unchanged this week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Great Lakes">
   <p>Status quo across Minnesota and Wisconsin this week, with no changes being made in the region.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Plains">
   <p>Most of the heaviest rains fell across eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas last week, bringing with them improvement and a westward shift of moderate drought (D1)  and abnormal dryness (D0). Amounts of 3-5 inches were common across southeastern Kansas, eastern Oklahoma, and eastern Texas.</p>
   <p>Not everyone shared in the rain, though. Deep southern Texas hasn't seen ample rains for more than six months now, leading to a deterioration and expansion of D2 and D3 into the Brownsville area.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic States">
   <p>After expansion into the region last week, most of the Mid-Atlantic stays as is this week, with the heavier rains falling more to the south. As a result, some minor improvements are noted in Virginia with a slight trimming of the D0-D1 in the extreme southwestern reaches of the state where the best rains (2 to 3 inches) were reported. The region still bears watching as we enter into the higher demand seasons of spring and summer.</p>
   <p>It was a completely different story, however, in the Southeast this past week as heavy rains pounded the region and altered the landscape from one of drought to one of deluges. Widespread totals of 3 to 6 inches or more were reported across the Gulf Coast states from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle and up into northern Georgia and the western Carolinas as well. Marked changes of improvement are noted on the heels of this drought-breaking rain, with removal of D1-D2 in Louisiana, D1 in southern Mississippi and Alabama, and D2 in northeastern Georgia and western North Carolina. A large chunk of the D1H remaining in Georgia has been pushed to the northeast corner and to the east in the central and southern parts of the state. This reflects the lagging recovery of hydrologic drought (below-normal streamflow and groundwater levels), which is typically slower to come out of drought, much in the same way it is slower going into drought. A reduced pocket of D2 remains in upstate South Carolina where streams and groundwater levels are still lagging behind in their recovery at this time. In addition, D0 was removed from all but extreme northern Louisiana, all of Mississippi, and all but a sliver of extreme east-central Alabama along with the Florida Panhandle, with the potential for more heavy rains over the next week. The rest of Florida remains unchanged this week. Abnormally dry (D0) conditions in central and southern Tennessee have been eroded away and pushed east. Worth noting is the fact that this is the first time since February 2007 that Alabama has been drought free.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>It was a relatively quiet week all in all over the drought-affected areas of the West, leading to no changes this week. Seasonal and water year (since October 1) deficits still bear watching as the dry (demand) season is just around the corner now. Of additional benefit is the fact that all but California saw a cooler-than-normal week.</p>
