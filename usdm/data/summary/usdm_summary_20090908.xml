  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>For September 9–14, 2009, widespread moderate to heavy rainfall (1.5 to 3.5 inches) is forecast for the most severely affected areas of drought in Texas, with moderate to heavy totals anticipated for most other areas of dryness and drought from the southern High Plains eastward through the central Gulf Coast states. Moderate to heavy precipitation is also forecast for the dry areas from the eastern Dakotas eastward across Minnesota and much of Wisconsin, and for Georgia and the western Carolinas. Other parts of the country affected by dryness and drought are expecting only a few tenths of an inch of precipitation, if any. During the ensuing 5 days (September 15–19, 2009), the odds favor above-normal precipitation for the dry areas in the Atlantic Coast states, the central Gulf Coast, northwestern Washington, and southeastern Alaska. In contrast, below-normal totals are more likely from the Intermountain West eastward through most of the Plains above southern and easternmost Texas, and across the western Great Lakes region.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Locally heavy rainfall led to the retraction of D0 conditions from part of southern Alaska, but only scattered light to moderate amounts fell elsewhere, leading to unchanged D0 to D3 conditions across the remainder of Alaska and all of Hawaii.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Atlantic Coast States">
   <p>A coastal storm brought moderate to heavy rainfall late in the period to the eastern tier of North Carolina, part of north-central North Carolina, and adjacent parts of Virginia. Between 2 and 5 inches were measured at a number of sites, and as a result, D0 conditions were eliminated in these areas. Across the rest of the Carolinas and Georgia, however, little or no precipitation fell, prompting limited expansion of the D1 areas in both Carolinas and the extension of D0 conditions through much of central and southern South Carolina.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Central Plains">
   <p>A few locations in southeastern Nebraska recorded 0.5 to 2.0 inches of rain last week, but there was little change in the multi-month precipitation deficits affecting the region, and D0 conditions persisted.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Midwest">
   <p>It was a dry week for most of the region, bringing an end to several weeks of generally wet weather and improvement to much of the drought-affected regions. This week, improvement was limited to part of north-central North Dakota, where a small area recorded 1 to locally 3 inches of rainfall. Most other areas of dryness and drought were essentially unchanged, but increasing short-term deficits led to the expansion of D0 conditions in southwestern and northeastern North Dakota, parts of eastern South Dakota and adjacent Minnesota, northern Iowa, and the southern half of Wisconsin. These areas received several inches less than normal precipitation for the past couple of months, although precipitation on longer time scales is generally near or above normal. Elsewhere, D1 conditions expanded into parts of northern North Dakota, and moderate drought was introduced in part of the Mississippi River headwaters in north-central Minnesota, where precipitation totals since April 1, 2009 are at least 6 inches below normal.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southern Plains and Gulf Coast Region">
   <p>As is typical of this time of year, scattered moderate and isolated heavy rains were reported across Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi last week, with some locations reporting several inches of rain from locally heavy thunderstorm activity while nearby sites recorded little or none. The spotty rainfall led to a few changes in the Drought Monitor this week, though exceptional drought still covers a large part of central and southern Texas. However, D2 to D4 conditions between Houston, TX and San Antonio, TX generally improved by 1 category, and improvement was also noted along the southern Texas border with Mexico. Farther north, D0 conditions across parts of central Texas were eliminated, and D1 conditions improved in areas near Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and adjacent Mississippi. In addition, spotty rainfall and a re-assessment of conditions led to the removal of D0 conditions from the Panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. Unfortunately, a dry week and growing precipitation deficits on time scales ranging from the last couple of months to the last 2 years led to D0 expansion in southwestern Oklahoma and the introduction of D1 conditions in adjacent areas near the Red River. During the last 2 years, much of this region received one foot less precipitation than normal, although shorter-term deficits are much more modest.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The West">
   <p>Widespread heavy rainfall (1 to locally 5 inches) covered western Washington and northwestern Oregon last week while moderate amounts (0.5 to 2.0 inches) fell on west-central Oregon, central Washington, and scattered locations across Arizona, New Mexico, and adjacent portions of neighboring states. Elsewhere, scattered light precipitation was observed across the Rockies and northern Intermountain West while little or none fell elsewhere. This precipitation pattern prompted the elimination of D2 conditions from westernmost Washington, and improvement from D1 to D0 in northwestern Oregon. In contrast, subnormal monsoonal precipitation so far this summer led to D1 expansion in parts of northern and eastern Arizona and adjacent New Mexico despite scattered rainfall this past week, and D0 conditions were extended into the northwestern quarter of Colorado in response to growing precipitation deficits during the past few months.</p>
