  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <intro>
   <p>After a dry March, a series of storms brought much needed precipitation to the Pacific Northwest, staving off further degradations in Washington and resulting in local flooding and broad drought improvements in Oregon.  Elsewhere, the West remained largely status quo with the only degradation in drought conditions occurring in the Big Horn Mountains where snowpack has been well below normal all winter.  The South and Southeast saw a mixture of improvements and degradations.  Locally heavy rainfall brought improvements to parts of Texas, Louisiana, and the Carolinas while areas such as southeastern Alabama saw an expansion of moderate drought.  Much of the remainder of the country remains largely free of drought and abnormal dryness.</p>

  <forecast>
   <p>By the time of this map’s release, a powerful storm will be impacting much of the U.S., bringing heavy rain and mountain snow to the West; blizzard conditions, flooding rain, and severe weather to the Plains and Midwest; and showers and thunderstorms to the South.  Behind the storm, parts of the Southern High Plains in Texas and New Mexico will experience fire weather conditions as very dry air and high winds affect the region.   As the storm progresses eastward, parts of the Northeast are expected to see rainfall by the end of the week.  Another system moving towards the West Coast this weekend is expected to bring low elevation rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West over the coming week.  If the forecast verifies, next week’s map could see additional improvements to drought areas in the Northwest and South.</p>

  <region name="Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico">
   <p>Moderate and severe drought continued in southeastern Alaska.  This week, the impact designation was changed from “L” to “SL”, to indicate that the area is experiencing short-term impacts and seasonal shortages in precipitation in addition to those caused by long-term dryness.  Reduced hydropower caused by low reservoir levels has necessitated the use of diesel generators, negatively affecting air quality in the region. In Hawaii, weekend rain on the windward side of the Big Island was of little benefit to the existing drought areas. Moderate drought conditions spread eastward into the Honokaa and Ookala areas and over the upper slopes of Mauna Kea. Ranchers in the area reported hauling water for cattle due to poor pasture conditions. Moderate drought also expanded near South Point.  The leeward areas of Oahu continued to dry out, resulting in the expansion of moderate drought.  Dry conditions have been a contributing factor to recent brush fires outside of Honolulu. Rainfall brought some relief to the abnormally dry areas in northwestern Puerto Rico, with the exception of Rincon, Aguada, and Anasco.  Abnormal dryness also developed on the southwestern and south-central part of the island which are experiencing elevated fire conditions.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="High Plains">
   <p>Precipitation across the High Plains was generally near normal over the last week, with the exception of northeast Nebraska and southeast South Dakota.  Temperatures were warmer than normal in all but eastern North Dakota.  Temperatures ranged from 3 degrees below normal in Grand Forks to 14 degrees above normal in the Nebraska Panhandle.  No changes were made to the map this week and the area remains free of drought and abnormal dryness.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Midwest">
   <p>Cooler than normal temperatures prevailed across the Midwest last week with near normal precipitation falling across much of the region.  The region remained free of drought or abnormal dryness.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Northeast">
   <p>The Northeast saw the development of two abnormally dry regions, in western New York and northeast West Virginia.  Western New York has experienced precipitation deficits over the last three months, resulting in low streamflow values.  While the deficits in West Virginia have occurred over a shorter time scale, they are more pronounced with stations reporting precipitation totals over the last 30 days that fell within the top three driest in a nearly 200-year period of record.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="South">
   <p>Locally heavy rainfall, 4 to 8 inches, fell over parts of central and east Texas, southern Arkansas, Louisiana, and northern Mississippi. Abnormally dry conditions and moderate drought were improved in central and southern Louisiana, with dryness/drought persisting in areas where long-term precipitation and soil moisture deficits still exist.  Likewise, Mississippi saw a reduction in abnormal dryness in the south-central portion of the state.  Texas saw a mixture of improvements and degradations.  Conditions generally improved in central and south Texas where severe drought was eliminated and moderate drought and abnormal dryness were reduced in response to the recent rainfall and improved soil moisture.  Degradations generally occurred in the north Texas, which missed out on the surplus rainfall and where precipitation and soil moisture deficits continue to build.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Southeast">
   <p>The Southeast experienced warmer than normal temperatures. While much of the region saw above normal precipitation, it generally was not enough to overcome deficits of 5 to 7 inches in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle that have been in place since the beginning of the year.  Small reductions in abnormal dryness and/or moderate drought occurred in southeast North Carolina, northeast South Carolina, and in south Florida.  Moderate drought conditions expanded in parts of southeast Alabama, southwest Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle where deficits have continued to grow and streamflow and soil moisture remain low.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="West">
   <p>With the exception of Wyoming, conditions in the West improved or maintained status quo.  A series of storms brought heavy rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest resulting in the elimination of abnormal dryness in northern California and a one-category improvement over much of Oregon.  While Washington also received beneficial rains, the amounts were not sufficient to put a dent in the long-term deficits and drought emergencies still exist in several river basins.  Elsewhere, reductions in abnormal dryness also occurred in western Idaho, and in northern and east-central Nevada.  Moderate drought conditions developed in the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming where snowpack has been low all winter.</p>
