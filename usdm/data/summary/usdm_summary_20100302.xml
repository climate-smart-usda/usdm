  <disclaimer>The discussion in the Looking Ahead section is simply a description of what the official national guidance from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction is depicting for current areas of dryness and drought. The NWS forecast products utilized include the HPC 5-day QPF and 5-day Mean Temperature progs, the 6-10 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, and the 8-14 Day Outlooks of Temperature and Precipitation Probability, valid as of late Wednesday afternoon of the USDM release week. The NWS forecast web page used for this section is: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/forecasts/.</disclaimer>  <forecast>
   <p>The next 5 days (March 4 – 8, 2010) looks relatively dry for most parts of the contiguous 48 states currently affected by dryness and drought. Generally 0.25 to locally 1.50 inches of precipitation is forecast from California eastward through Nevada, central and northern Arizona, Utah, southern Idaho, Wyoming, and Colorado, with the larger amounts expected in the coastal and Sierra Nevada regions of California and scattered higher elevations in the central Rockies. Elsewhere, only a few tenths of an inch is expected, if anything, including the dry areas in the Upper Midwest and the lower Ohio Valley. For the ensuing 5 days, the odds favor above-normal precipitation in the southwestern two-thirds of Alaska, the West Coast from central California northward through western Oregon, the Upper Midwest, and the lower Ohio Valley. In contrast, subnormal amounts appear more likely from central and southern Arizona eastward through the Big Bend region of Texas, and across Montana and most of the Idaho Panhandle.</p>

  <region name="Hawaii, Alaska and Micronesia">
   <p>The worst drought in the nation continues impacting the state of Hawaii. Water supplies for ranchers in northwest sections of the Big Island have been unprecedentedly poor, and growing precipitation deficits led to the introduction of D4 in this area. This marks the first time since the inception of the Drought Monitor that such poor conditions have been assessed for any part of the state. Since the start of the calendar year, Lihue (on Kauai), Honolulu (Oahu), and Kahului (Maui) have reported 1.38 to 2.00 inches of rain, compared to normal amounts of 5.23 to 8.07 inches for the period. Hilo, on the Big Island, received only 2.65 inches for this period, compared to a normal total of 19.39 inches.</p>
   <p>In Alaska, little or no precipitation fell across much of the state.  Reports from near the southern shore, adjacent islands, and along the panhandle indicate precipitation amounts ranged from 1.4 to 5.1 inches.  The frozen ground and dormant vegetation provide minimal demand for ground water, so the depiction was maintained from last week.</p>
   <p>Although the region is not assessed by the Drought Monitor, it should be noted that drought has developed recently through most of Micronesia, including Guam, where February precipitation totals of around 0.5 inch were only about 15 percent of normal.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="Texas">
   <p>The abnormally dry areas in Texas reported only a few tenths of an inch of rain this past week, but with precipitation totals in most of these areas near- to above-normal for the past 90 to 180 days, most of the D0 conditions in southern Texas were removed this week, save for a small area in far southwest Texas which has not fared as well over the past 3 to 6 months. Farther northwest, D0 conditions persisted in part of western Texas.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Northern Rockies and Northwest">
   <p>Most interior locations reported less than 0.5 inch of precipitation, though some of the highest elevations recorded a bit more. Meanwhile, one to several inches fell on areas from the Cascades westward. Continued near- to above-normal precipitation in central Washington prompted some improvements on the  western sides of the D1 and D2 areas, but many areas farther east and southeast remained in the grip of moderate to severe drought. Since the start of the water year on October 1, 2009, precipitation has totaled 4 to 8 inches below normal in much of western Washington and Oregon, and through most of the Idaho Panhandle and part of adjacent Montana. As of early March, snowpack was at or near record low level at many locations from northeastern Utah northward along and near the Idaho border with Montana and Wyoming. Furthermore, numerous sites in Idaho reported the driest or second-driest November – February period in 20 to 45 years of record. No deteriorations were introduced in northern parts of the Rockies and Intermountain West this week, but many areas may decline in the near future if more precipitation is not forthcoming.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Southwest">
   <p>Most locations across the southwestern quarter of the country recorded less than 0.5 inch of precipitation, although most of the dry areas in California and parts of the higher elevations in Arizona reported one to several inches. Record snowpack for early March in the higher elevations of Arizona and surplus precipitation on the whole for the past 6 months led to the removal of D0 conditions there, and some improvements to former D1 conditions in southern parts of the state were also introduced. In other parts of the area, no change was made in the Drought Monitor depiction last week.</p>
  </region>
  <region name="The Upper Mid-west">
   <p>No changes were made in this region. Most areas reported at at least a few tenths of an inch of precipitation last week, with totals exceeding an inch reported on parts of the northern Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Over the course of the past 2 years, northern Wisconsin accumulated precipitation totals 12 to 20 inches below normal.</p>
